Alerting
Last Seven Days Alert Trend

We have added a ticket alert column to the Intelligent Alerts details page where you can view the count of alerts generated in the last seven days.

Green indicates no alerts have been generated
Blue indicates that alerts were generated and closed on the same day
Red color indicates that there are open alerts that did not get closed on the same day

By hovering over these bars, you will be able to view the specific alerts. The alert and ticket count will be based on the monitor output you have selected. If you select a "do not generate" status, you will not receive tickets for that condition, but you will still be able to see the count in this column.

Donut Chart Update
We have updated the donut chart component on the intelligent alert, monitors, and suspension page.
Improved Logic
We have released improved logic for "Multiple VSS writers are in failed state" condition.
Issues Addressed
Known Issue	Description
 	Fixed an issue where the Asset Monitor allowed monitor entities to be empty.
 	Fixed an issue where an Automation task associated with an Intelligent Alert was not getting triggered if Device Group was selected as the target.
 	Fixed an issue where the default automation that was associated with certain intelligent alert conditions was not getting triggered.
 	Fixed an issue where partners were not receiving alert ticket for linux virtual server machines.
