Servers
The ConnectWise RMM Server Agent works on any cloud deployment model, including on-premises, public cloud, and private cloud.
Existing IntelliMon alerts have been tuned specifically for Microsoft Azure to filter out non-relevant events and exclude virtual platforms where necessary.
Azure-Specific Alerts

ConnectWise has also created dedicated alert families for the following Azure services:

Azure AD Connect

Azure AD Connect integrates your on-premises directories with Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory). This allows you to provide a common identity to users for Office 365, Azure, and SaaS applications integrated with Microsoft Entra ID. Refer to Azure AD Connect for more information.

Family	Condition Name	Impact	Benefit
Azure AD Synchronization	

AD Sync failing due to duplicate entries found

	Critical Non-Impact	

This rule indicates duplicates entries to avoid conflict errors in Active Directory Database.


Azure AD Synchronization	

Azure AD Connect services won't start

	Critical Non-Impact	

Detects situations where the Password sync feature is not enabled in the Tenant.


Azure AD Synchronization	

Azure Sync connectivity issue

	Critical Non-Impact	

Monitors Azure Active directory Sync failures.


Azure AD Synchronization	

Directory Synchronization connectivity issue found

	Critical Non-Impact	

Reports connectivity errors when communicating with Azure AD, most commonly a credential issue.


Azure AD Synchronization	

DirSync / AD Sync encounter error

	Critical Non-Impact	

Monitoring Rules identifies internal database errors causing replication failure.


Azure AD Synchronization	

Error occurred communicating with Azure AD

	Critical Non-Impact	

Monitoring rule will help to Identify errors causing communication issues between On-Premise and Azure AD.


Azure AD Synchronization	

Export to Azure AD failed with error

	Critical Non-Impact	

Monitoring rule will help to Identify configuration change since the last run profile.

Azure Hyper-V Replication

Azure Hyper-V is utilized in Disaster Recovery (DR) scenarios to automate the failover process for bringing workloads back up at a secondary site with minimal downtime.

Family	Condition Name	Impact	Benefit
Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

VM Replication failed due to Azure Storage service failure

	Critical Non-Impact	

Indicates issues within the storage service


Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

Cannot replicate VM changes due to unspecified error

	Critical Non-Impact	

Identifies issues responsible for VM replication failures


Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

Export System Definition for VM failed

	Critical Non-Impact	

Provides notification when export activity is failing after repeated attempts.


Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

VM Replication failed due to Network Communication Failure

	Critical Non-Impact	

Identifies network errors causing VM replication failure.


Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

VM Replication failed due to Operation Was Cancelled

	Critical Non-Impact	

Identifies operating or task failures responsible for VM replication issues


Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

Resynchronization Failed for VM

	Critical Non-Impact	

Identifies errors responsible for VM replication failures


Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

VM Replication failed due to Timeout Interval Expired

	Critical Non-Impact	

Identifies VM replication failures due to timeout errors


Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

Replication/Resynchronization failed due to dependent Update Process Operation Failed

	Critical Non-Impact	

Helps to identify dependent components due to which VM update operation is failed.


Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

VM Cannot replicate changes due to intermittent Network Communication Failures

	Critical Non-Impact

Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

VM config not available - Failover not possible

	Critical Non-Impact	

This rule will help in identifying VM configuration issues.


Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

Configuration file for VM could not be sent to the Azure Site Recovery (failover may not be possible)

	Critical Non-Impact	

This rule will help in identifying issues where Failover to Azure cloud may not work as expected.


Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

VM marked as corrupted by service

	Critical Non-Impact	

This rule will help in identifying VM healthy state on Azure.


Azure Hyper-V Synchronization	

VM not enable for protection with service

	Critical Non-Impact	

Identifies VM's not enabled for protection on Azure.

Desktops
Virtual Desktops Provided by Public Cloud Providers

ConnectWise RMMs support virtual desktops provided through Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services using a Platform agent available for download:

Navigate to Endpoints > Devices.
Open the Manage drop-down menu and select Download Agent. For more information visit the Windows OS Agent documentation.
Remote Desktop Support on Microsoft RDS / Terminal Servers / Public Cloud VDI

The RMM Desktop Agent currently requires a persistent drive on all cloned imaged VMs for installing the RMM Agent (in order for the agent to function properly). Virtual Desktop configurations that require Golden or Clone Image functionality are not currently supported.
