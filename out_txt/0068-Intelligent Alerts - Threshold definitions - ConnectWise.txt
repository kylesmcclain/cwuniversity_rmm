The following table outlines the alert logic or thresholds defined in the pre-defined alerts

Condition Name	Condition Criticality	Family Name	Ticket generation logic	Ticket Closure logic
Agent Malfunction	Critical Impact Alerts	RMM Agent	
Agent Malfunction alert should be generated when the Device is offline in RMM but accessible via ScreenConnect.
If the partner has not enabled ScreenConnect then skip the alert generation as Device Down alert will be created for them.
	
Inverse Rule: If agent is reporting online then the Agent Malfunction alert should be closed.

Monitored Server / Device down or Site internet is down	Server/Internet Down	General (Up/Down/Reboot)	

Device is not communicating for 10 min

& 
Additional validation: ScreenConnect is NOT able to communicate with endpoints

	Device communication is initiated from the endpoint
