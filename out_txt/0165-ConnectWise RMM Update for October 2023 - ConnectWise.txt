Overview

This page provides information on the latest enhancements and features for ConnectWise RMM.

Announcements
Suspension per Endpoint

We are adding a new suspension tab under the endpoints > Monitoring section. This tab will display applicable suspension rules for these endpoints. This includes suspension rules for both Intelligent alerts and monitors.

Assign to another site (Move Agent)

We will be providing a simplified experience to Assign a device to another site. The option will be available in the Devices > Computers Page under the Manage Menu in the Action bar on the top of the page. This feature will be near real-time, where the movement will reflect in the portal near-instantly, with a max delay of up to 15 minutes.

ConnectWise PSA - Integration via policies EA

We are excited to announce that we will be adding an option for you to enable the ConnectWise PSA sync configurations that helps to define Tickets, Configuration items, and Notifications using policies. These policies can be included in your packages and applied to the sites using the package assignment option.

There will be no migration performed for the existing configuration, but the policies will be in effect if they are assigned or applied to a site. You will initially have a toggle button to either enable or disable the policies based configuration and continue using the old method for now.

We will stop supporting the older configuration method by December 15th.

Legacy deprecation

As we are moving towards RMM Site Configuration policies, the below legacy options would be removed for partners who opt-in for those policies:

For CW RMM partners: NOC Enabled/Disabled

For Command partners: Service Level - Essential/Preferred/Elite
