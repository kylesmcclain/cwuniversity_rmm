Overview 

This page provides information on the latest enhancements and features for ConnectWise RMM.

Announcements 
RMM Dashboard

We've released the ConnectWise RMM dashboard. The RMM dashboard provides a centralized view of all of your client's networks and devices, giving you real-time visibility into the performance and status of these systems. This allows you to quickly identify and resolve issues before they become major problems. For more information about this feature, visit the RMM Dashboard documentation. 

Cloud Monitoring

RMM Premium partners, you can now monitor your customers' Azure resource health and receive a ticket when any resource is anything but Available. For more information on this feature and setting it up, visit the Cloud Devices documentation.

UI Refresh - Communicator, OS Patching, Alert Management

As part of our ongoing efforts to provide a consistent UI experience across the platform, we have successfully refreshed the Communicator, OS Patching & Alert Management pages. With a uniform and consistent user interface, users will have a seamless and intuitive experience across the Communicator, OS Patching, and Alert Management pages. 

Enhanced Filtering Capabilities - OS Patching 

Users can now define their own date ranges for viewing data, instead of being limited to preset options, for OS Patching. This enhancement provides users with more control when managing and analyzing their data

ConnectWise PSA - Integration via policies EA

We are excited to announce that we will be adding an option for you to enable the ConnectWise PSA sync configurations that helps to define Tickets, Configuration items, and Notifications using policies. These policies can be included in your packages and applied to the sites using the package assignment option.

There will be no migration performed for the existing configuration, but the policies will be in effect if they are assigned or applied to a site. You will initially have a toggle button to either enable or disable the policies based configuration and continue using the old method for now.

We will stop supporting the older configuration method by December 15th.
