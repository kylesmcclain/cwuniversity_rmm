Overview

The following items are the enhancements, updates, and fixes for the August 2022 RMM release. 

Monitoring

IntelliMon customization will be updated for the following legacy Desktop monitoring conditions:

A system crash or unexpected reboot

Machine restart is required

System performance is low due to high paging

You will be able to make changes to the thresholds based on the condition requirements.

You can now customize the IntelliMon alerts for the desktop which will generate the alerts. The following changes will be applicable:

The Legacy Manage Threshold section for the Desktop alerts will not be applicable for any changes

You can view the current configurations defined but this data or information will not be migrated to the new IntelliMon customization

Alerts will be enabled by default for the desktop monitoring conditions

You can use suspension rules if you do not want to receive alerts for specific conditions

Once all the monitoring conditions on the Manage Threshold page is modified the legacy page will be deprecated. These features will release on the 26th of August.

Patching

Patches with Upgrade classification will be removed for Manual deployments from Quick patch actions or Patch approval page.

The compliance score formula will consider the exclusions and conditional approval settings for the install and pending reboot patches.

Portal

Agent Update. An agent update, version 2.1.804, will be rolled out in phased manner starting September 6th.

Legacy Gateway Validation and enablement. Agent removal will no longer have any validations if the legacy gateway is configured on the endpoint. Additionally, the Gateway tab on the RMM Setup for site will no longer be visible. You can enable the Gateway Cache from the Devices page for the specific endpoint as needed. No separate installation of the Gateway agent is needed.

RMM Scanning Tool Improvement. We are improving our RMM Scanning tool to automatically update to the latest version on endpoints. This will no longer require any user login to the RMM Scanning tool to prompt for the update.

Removal of the VMWare Dashboard widget. We will be removing the legacy VMWare Widget from the dashboard as the data or information displayed is outdated or obsolete.

Bug Fixes / Known Issues
