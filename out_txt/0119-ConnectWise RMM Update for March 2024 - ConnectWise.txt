Announcements 
Unbranding ConnectWise SSO Login Screens on Asio

Beginning March 19, 2024, all partners and clients who log in through the ConnectWise Asio® platform with ConnectWise SSO, will now have the same SSO login screen with a generic, unbranded look and feel. Please note that there will be no changes in the username, password, and MFA method configured to login.

Please take a moment to read the Unbranded Login Screens FAQ for further information about what this means for you and your clients.

ConnectWise PSA - Integration via policies 

This is a final reminder about an important update regarding RMM integration with ConnectWise PSA.

On April 15th, 2024 we will be retiring our Legacy PSA Configuration for Manage. To ensure uninterrupted sync with ConnectWise PSA and to take full advantage of our latest enhancement, we strongly encourage you to explore and adopt the improved RMM and ConnectWise PSA sync configurations that could be integrated using policies.

This is your last opportunity to act before the Legacy PSA Configuration is deprecated. Ticket, configuration item, and notifications for sync failure would be disabled unless ConnectWise PSA Policies are not enabled.

Autotask PSA - Integration via policies

We are excited to announce that we will be adding an option for partners to enable the Autotask PSA sync configurations that defines Ticket, Configuration item, and Contacts using policies. These policies can be included in the packages and applied to the sites using the package assignment option.

The Policy improvement will have additional features like Syncing Friendly Name to Autotask PSA. With the newer integration, you will have the option to select custom note types in Inward and Outward Note Type Sync.

There will be no migration performed for the existing configuration, but the policies will take effect if they are assigned or applied to a site. You will initially have a toggle button to either enable or disable the policies-based configuration and continue using the old method for now.

We will completely stop supporting the older configuration method by May 1st, 2024.

Data Consistency in Asio Reporting

Asio reporting will be improved to ensure consistency in data across the Asio platform and Reporting pages. This enhancement will apply to the following reports:

Agent Report
Agent Uninstall Report

In addition to data consistency, we are also streamlining the reports by removing fields that are no longer applicable.

Asio reporting will be enhanced in future releases to include additional fields, providing partners with a comprehensive view of information in a single report.

Future Reports planned -

System Information Report 
Installed Software Report
Disk Space Report
Introducing Webroot Integration 2.0 - Non-bundled Integration

Partners who already have Webroot licenses purchased externally (including ConnectWise marketplace) will now be able to integrate and manage their Webroot endpoints through the Asio Platform.

Device Groups

Fix for Dynamic Group criteria 'Internal IP Address' not working: Resolved an issue where the 'Internal IP Address' criteria in Dynamic Groups was not functioning properly, causing machines to not be listed in the specified IP range.
