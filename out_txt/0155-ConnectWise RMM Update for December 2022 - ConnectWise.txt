Legacy Custom Report & Executive Report Deprecation notice for ConnectWise RMM

We are deprecating the Legacy custom report and Executive reports for ConnectWise RMM partners on January 6th, 2022.

Asset Monitor

We are adding a new capability for creating Asset monitors to generate alerts in the system when a value is updated in an asset. Based on the criteria defined for the monitor, we will trigger an alert and execute corresponding automation if defined. Please review the Asset Monitor article.

Duo MFA Vulnerability Fix

If you are using DUO MFA for your Asio authentication, the Secret key and Integration key have been visible to users and also shared with the client in plaintext. This posed a risk to your confidential information. We are fixing this on December 20th, 2022.

We've added a checkbox that works the same as the click to edit password functionality on the Edit User screen.

If Duo is already configured, the user can be saved without setting up Duo MFA. If Duo isn't configured and the checkbox is unchecked, the user is shown the error "Duo MFA not configured."

ConnectWise RMM
Agent and Platform

Agent Update. An agent update, version 3.0.2, will be rolled out in phased manner starting December 16th. Global rollout will be completed within seven days.

Support Agent on Ubuntu 22.04. The Linux agent on Ubuntu 22.04 will be supported from version 3.0.2.

Automation

Automation loops. Partner scripts can now loop through multiple values for a variable (usernames, drives, installed software, etc.) and perform an action for each value.

New task for deploying Windows 10 22H2 Feature on endpoints. We've added a new task that allows you to deploy Windows 10 22H2 Feature updates using the 2.0 tasking. This gives you a faster and more reliable deployment.

Intune Integration

Alerts for MS Intune. Users will receive an alert when an endpoint managed in MS Intune moves to the Not Compliant State.

Portal

Improvement to the ticket page load time. We are removing unneeded sections on the tickets page which should help improve the page load time and response.

Bug Fixes / Known Issues

The following issues will be resolved with this month's release:

Communicator UI: We are fixing the following issue on January 4th. In the Communicator Send Message Card, the Send/Cancel button and the close window icon were hidden. Users were unable to scroll up and down on 100% zoom level on the browser. This defect also impacted Calendar Format. This will require an Asio™ Platform (ITSupport Portal) configuration release.
