Overview

Here is a list of some of the script functions you can use.

Current Script Functions include:
Script Function	Description	Example
Script Exit	Triggers the script to fail, stop, & log a user defined error message.	Unexpected PowerShell result detected.
Script Log	Triggers the script to log an informational user defined message.	Powershell result: %output%.
Set Custom Field	Triggers the script to update any Custom Field selected by the user.	Update Custom Field hasScriptRun Flag from No to Yes (aka. check the box).
Set User Variable	Triggers the script to create a runtime variable based on what you manually enter.	Set variable PowerShellResult to %output% (so multiple Logic Conditions can check the result of a single PowerShell script).
Set Pre-defined Variable	Triggers the script to create a runtime variable based on data available in the Asio platform.	Set variable CustomField to [select specific Custom Field] OR set the predefined variable by referring to this list of Predefined System Variables.

 

Note: Variables can be called from other functions by using the @ sign before and after the Variable name.

Example: @PowerShellResult@ can be used to call the User Variable Example and @CustomField@ can be used to call the Pre-defined Variable Example.
