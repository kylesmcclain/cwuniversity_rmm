Overview 

This page provides information on the latest enhancements and features for ConnectWise RMM.

Announcements 
ConnectWise PSA - Integration via policies 

This is a final reminder about an important update regarding RMM integration with ConnectWise PSA.

On May 15th, 2024 we will be retiring our Legacy PSA Configuration for Manage. To ensure uninterrupted sync with ConnectWise PSA and to take full advantage of our latest enhancement, we strongly encourage you to explore and adopt the improved RMM and ConnectWise PSA sync configurations that could be integrated using policies.

This is your last opportunity to act before the Legacy PSA Configuration is deprecated. Ticket, configuration item, and notifications for sync failure would be disabled unless ConnectWise PSA Policies are not enabled.

Autotask PSA - Integration via policies

We will be adding an option for partners to enable the Autotask PSA sync configurations that defines Ticket, Configuration item, and Contacts using policies. These policies can be included in the packages and applied to the sites using the package assignment option.

The Policy improvement will have additional features like Syncing Friendly Name to Autotask PSA. With the newer integration, you will have the option to select custom note types in Inward and Outward Note Type Sync.

There will be no migration performed for the existing configuration, but the policies will take effect if they are assigned or applied to a site. You will initially have a toggle button to either enable or disable the policies-based configuration and continue using the old method for now.

We will completely stop supporting the older configuration method by May 1st, 2024.

Autotask PSA Integration - Catchall Company Selection

We are offering an upgrade to Ticket Sync for Autotask PSA Integration. The updated Catchall Company selection on the UI allows you to sync your RMM tickets to a single Autotask PSA company.

Tickets for unmapped RMM Companies and Sites with PSA Policy applied will be synced into Catchall Company and Sites. This feature improvement will be available for Policy opted partners.

Please map all the unmapped RMM sites to their relevant Autotask PSA companies so that ticket sync works as planned after release.

The improved feature will be released on April 25th, 2024.
