Overview

The Communicator hidden mode allows the end-user to receive Patch Reboot Notifications and Messages from the Portal, even if the Communicator is disabled on the endpoint in the policy. Hidden mode means the Communicator tray is not visible or accessible to the end-user. Still, at the same time, the end-user will be able to review the Patch Reboot Notification and Messages and act on it.

For example:
If the Communicator Policy is disabled on the endpoint,

And if the Patching Desktop/Server Policy setting "Notify user before reboot" is ON for the endpoint,

Then the Communicator will be running in hidden mode.
