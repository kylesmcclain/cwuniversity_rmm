ConnectWise Help Desk Services
Change in Process on Initial Email Response from ConnectWise Help Desk Services

We are introducing an enhancement to the Help Desk process to improve efficiency and provide better support for end users.

Current Process:

When a ticket is received via email, the Help Desk replies to confirm a convenient time to speak and troubleshoot the issue.

New Process (Effective 11/24):

The Help Desk reply will continue to request a convenient time for troubleshooting.
Additionally, the same email will now include:
Context-specific self-help instructions for resolving similar issues
Details on information the technician will need to expedite troubleshooting (e.g., screenshots, error messages, system details)

Benefits:

Faster resolution by empowering users with actionable steps
Reduced back-and-forth communication before scheduling
Improved clarity on what is required for effective troubleshooting
