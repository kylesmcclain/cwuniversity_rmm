Overview 

This page provides information on the latest enhancements and features for ConnectWise RMM.

Announcements
ConnectWise Asio® Performance Enhancements

Note: This will be released in the second week of September 2025.

We’re changing the default data collection for the CPU, Memory, and Disk from managed endpoints to align with other solutions and bring uniformity in data collection and how the information is used for displaying on UI/Alerting processes.

Previously, this data was captured every 3 minutes. Starting the second week of September 2025, the collection interval will be updated to every 5 minutes.

There is no change to how performance data appears on the Device Details page.
All metrics will continue to be displayed as they are today.

Tip: If you have configured custom monitors for CPU, Disk, and Memory, we recommend reviewing and updating the Condition/Ticket resolution section to align with the new 5-minute interval for data collection from the endpoints.

For any questions or assistance, reach out to your ConnectWise RMM support teams.

PSA Integration
We have introduced the ability to map custom PSA configuration types for each agent type supported by ConnectWise RMM. This enhances your integration with ConnectWise PSA. For more information, review this Asset Sync documentation.
ConnectWise NOC Services

ConnectWise NOC Services SOW Update – NOC Service Delivery (09/19/2025)

We’ve made targeted updates to our NOC Statement of Work to improve operational clarity and partner experience:

Credential Handling: Tickets now require passwords in the Password Vault for NOC action; missing credentials will escalate tickets to your team, reducing delays.
Expanded Platform Support: NOC now covers Microsoft Hyper-V and has broadened support for Exchange/O365, Entra Connect Sync, DFS, Azure, and VMware—enabling faster, more comprehensive incident response.
Clearer Ad Hoc Request Handling: Sections for Exchange, Azure, and VMware have been streamlined for easier partner engagement.

These changes mean quicker ticket routing, broader technical coverage, and more predictable support outcomes for your teams.

For the full list of updates, please review the Revision History in the SOW document.

September 17, 2025
Device Groups Criteria

New criteria support for Device Group

We have included the OS Patch compliance score and Pending Reboot for the Device Group criteria definitions. Review this documentation for all supported criteria for Device Groups.
September 9, 2025
Automation
Enhanced the Script Editor to include a new 'Add Note' option on every script step. Now, you can document the purpose or logic behind each step, making scripts easier to understand, maintain, and troubleshoot. Documentation to be updated soon.
Enhanced the Script Editor to allow enabling or disabling individual script steps, so you can test and troubleshoot scripts more flexibly without deleting or modifying step logic. This feature is available on the overflow menu (three dots) or on selection of one or more steps in the script editor. Documentation to be updated soon.
Extended Script Editor support for running steps in the Current Logged-In User context to Linux and macOS—initially available only for Windows.
September 5, 2025
Device Groups

Device Groups Neon Theme Updates

We have updated the Device Groups landing and the new Device Group pages to align with the Asio Neon theme. These changes bring additional features as follows:
Alignment of the pages with other Asio pages
Paginated responses for faster page loading
Improved user interface for easier accessibility for creating/viewing data for Device Groups
Column pickers on the grid to view data
Downloading the Device Groups created

Support for the Category field for Device Groups

Device Groups now support the Category field for all existing and new Device Groups created. You will be presented with the new device group category option to select as a drop-down or create a new category for the Device Groups.
The Category field is visible on the side card on the Device Groups page, but it also supports filtering to make data easier to access.
September 4, 2025
Alerting
Partners can now edit conditions for Default Automation in Intelligent Alerts, allowing them to opt in or out as needed. Partners have the flexibility to apply or exclude automation for specific target endpoints.
You can now configure workflows in ConnectWise Asio® to trigger when an Alert is created for selected monitor types or individual monitors. This gives you more control over how alerts are handled and allows you to define actions that follow alert generation. For more information, review the Alert created as a Trigger section in the Custom Monitors article.
