Automation Support Update

Support for legacy scripting for Command partners will be discontinued on August 19th. This will be completed in two phases

Phase 1: The UI view for legacy scripting will be removed on August 19th. However, active templates will continue to run in the backend. You will have the ability to move templates from the legacy version to 2.0 until Phase 2.
Phase 2: During Phase 2, scripts will no longer run as the legacy component will be deprecated. After this phase, you will not be able to copy over templates to the 2.0 version.
