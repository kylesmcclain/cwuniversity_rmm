Overview 

This page provides information on the latest enhancements and features for ConnectWise RMM.

Announcements 
Coming Soon: Generic ConnectWise SSO login screen in ConnectWise Asio platform

As part of our ongoing effort to streamline and enhance user experience, we will soon be rolling out a new look and feel for the ConnectWise single sign-on login screen for all our ConnectWise Asio® platform partners. For consistency, all partners and clients who log in through Asio, will now have the same ConnectWise SSO login screen with a general, unbranded look and feel. Please note that how you login will not change. Your username, password, and where you go to login will remain the same.   

We will be sending additional communication and notifications when the feature is enabled and released.

Coming Soon: Migration of end-user login to ConnectWise SSO

As part of our ongoing commitment to a security-first culture and to enhance user experience, your client end users will be gradually migrated to ConnectWise single sign-on (SSO). This migration ensures a unified login experience across all our services and applications for client end users.

We will be sending additional communication and notifications when the feature is enabled and released.

Coming Soon: Data Consistency in Asio Reporting

Asio reporting will be improved to ensure consistency in data across the Asio Platform and reporting pages. This enhancement will apply to the following reports:

Agent Report
Agent Uninstall Report
System Information Report

In addition to data consistency, we are also streamlining the reports by removing fields that are no longer applicable.

The Asio reporting will be enhanced in future releases to include additional fields, providing partners with a comprehensive view of information in a single report.

For our first update, we are introducing an 'OR' filter option for reports. Now you can use either the 'AND' or 'OR' operator in your report filters for more flexibility and customization.

Note: The two operators cannot be combined within a single filter; you must choose one or the other.

ConnectWise PSA - Integration via policies 

This is a final reminder about an important update regarding RMM integration with ConnectWise PSA.

On March 15th, 2024 we will be retiring our Legacy PSA Configuration for Manage. To ensure uninterrupted sync with ConnectWise PSA and to take full advantage of our latest enhancement, we strongly encourage you to explore and adopt the improved RMM & ConnectWise PSA sync configurations that could be integrated using policies.

This is your last opportunity to act before the Legacy PSA Configuration is deprecated. Ticket, configuration item and notifications for sync failure would be disabled unless ConnectWise PSA Policies are not enabled.

Autotask PSA - Integration via policies

We are excited to announce that we will be adding an option for partners to enable the Autotask PSA sync configurations that defines Ticket, Configuration item, and Contacts using policies. These policies can be included in the packages and applied to the sites using the package assignment option.

The Policy improvement will have additional features like Syncing Friendly Name to Autotask PSA. With the newer integration you will have the option to select custom note types in Inward and Outward Note Type Sync.

There will be no migration performed for the existing configuration, but the policies will take effect if they are assigned or applied to a site. You will initially have a toggle button to either enable or disable the policies-based configuration and continue using the old method for now.

We will completely stop supporting the older configuration method by April 1st, 2024.

Custom Monitors at the Company Level

Partners who are migrated to the Company/Site level hierarchy will be able to see a new monitoring tab under Company which should have a sub-tab for monitors. This section will allow you to see the monitors that are applied at the Company level.

Suspension at the Company Level

Partners who are migrated to the Company/Site level hierarchy will be able to see a new monitoring tab under Company which should have a sub-tab for suspension. This section will allow you to see suspensions that are applied at the Company level.

RMM Site Configuration Policy

We are upgrading the experience of enabling the RMM capabilities on a Site. The new RMM Site Configuration policy will be replacing the 1.0 based experience from RMM Setup to create or convert a site into an RMM site. Going forward, you can create one or more RMM Site Configuration policies, with the options to enable or disable RMM capabilities, enable or disable NOC Services, and add a Notification Rule to be followed. 

This policy will simplify how users can update RMM capabilities on multiple sites with ease, without having to change the configuration for every site by visiting the site and making the same changes.
