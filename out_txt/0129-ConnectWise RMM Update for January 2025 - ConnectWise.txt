Announcements
Premier Network Monitoring is now available!

We have introduced a new tier to our Network Monitoring solution, Premier. This tier gives you all of the features of basic and advanced network monitoring, but includes new features such as Syslog and Traffic Insights. This solution is available to RMM Pro and Premium partners. For more information on how to upgrade and use this new solution, review the following documentation. We have also created a solution comparison page, so you can choose which tier works best for your needs.

PSA Policy Toggle to be Removed

This month, we are removing the PSA Policy enablement toggle from the reporting page for CW PSA partners for partners who have already enabled their PSA Policy. This means that partners who have already opted for the policy will no longer see the toggle on the user interface and will not be able to switch it back to the legacy integration. Instead, they will need to utilize the improved PSA Policy for configuring PSA sync entities.
