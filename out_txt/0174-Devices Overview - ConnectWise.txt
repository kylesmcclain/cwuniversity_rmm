Overview

The information on the Device list provides a high-level view of all sites or filtered sites and includes easy-to-view details for applicable endpoints.

To Access Devices

Note: Internet Explorer (IE) 11 is not recommended for this process.

Navigate to Endpoints > Devices.
The Devices list shows all endpoints across the ecosystem for centralized viewing and management. Users can find and manage Linux servers, Mac desktops, Windows desktops, and servers within sites.

The Devices list includes tabs for different categories: General, Patching, Integrations, Networking, and Backup.

General Tab

The General tab is the default Devices landing page and includes high-level information specific to each endpoint.

Note: To sort a column, click any column header.
