Overview

The Device grid shows all managed ConnectWise Asio® platform endpoints. This article can help you customize the grid to show different data views and easily locate device information.

To Access Devices (Preview)
Navigate to Endpoints > Devices (Preview).
The Devices list shows all endpoints across the ecosystem for centralized viewing and management. Users can find and manage Linux servers, Windows desktops, and servers within sites. 
The Default View is the main landing page when navigating to Devices. This view is standard for all partners and cannot be modified.

Search

Use the Device page's search feature to find specific terms, such as endpoint name, or to perform a general search with less exact keywords across environments (by name, friendly name, last user, OS version, etc.). You can also use the filter to help you find the endpoint you are looking for.


Adding a Filter

Follow the steps below to add a filter to your Devices page.

Click the Filter icon next to the search bar.

Fill in the Columns, Operator, and Value fields.

To add another filter, click Add filter. When adding a filter, the AND and OR options allow you to filter devices with matching or different qualifications.

Click Done.
To add and delete filters, click the Filter icon again.
Creating a Custom View

Follow the steps below to create a custom view based on any of the available data points on the grid. The custom view saves after logging out of Asio.

Navigate to Endpoints > Devices.
Click Default View and to open the drop-down.

Select Create new view.

Enter a unique View Name.
Select the data fields to add to the view from the right-hand side of the dialogue. Each view can contain up to 30 data fields that define the view. Optionally, you can locate data using:
Search the name of the data field.
Select Category or Subcategory filter criteria.
Add filters and sorting criteria to the view.

Click Save View.
To edit a custom view, click the Custom View drop-down and click the edit icon. To delete a custom view, click the delete icon.

Exporting a View

To export one or more device records from the grid, select the devices of interest from the grid by selecting individual device records on the left-hand side. The Select All option at the top of the device grid either selects the full page or all available devices in the view.

Click Continue.

Then, select the Export near the top-right of the grid.

Note: By default, if no device records are selected, then the entire contents of the grid will be exported.

Available Data Fields on the Device Grid

Note: More data fields are added continuously. Check in periodically to stay updated with the data fields.
