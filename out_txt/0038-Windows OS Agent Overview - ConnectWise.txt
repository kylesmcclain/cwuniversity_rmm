Download and Install Windows OS Agents
Overview

Every Windows, Mac, or Linux OS device (Desktop or Server) must have the agent installed in order for it to report back to the ConnectWise Asio® platform with monitoring information. Agents can be downloaded from the Asio platform and installed on your endpoint directly or remotely.

Note: Agents are self-updating and check for new updates once daily. If an Agent falls multiple updates behind, the Agent performs one update per day until it has been fully updated.

This article provides information and instructions about how to download and install an agent on your device.

Prerequisites
Asio companies and sites. Please refer to Setting Up Your Asio platform for more information.
Full Agent Management permissions via a default or custom application role.
Review the agent prerequisites and compatibility information for the respective OS available in Prerequisites.

Hardware Requirement
CPU: Pentium 4 or comparable processor.
Supports Windows on ARM processor or Snapdragon processor
Supports on 32-bit and 64-bit processor
RAM: 2 GB and above.
Disk Storage: 2.5 GB on the drive where the agent will be installed (If endpoint to be enabled as Gateway cache recommended free space is 4GB)

Disk storage for auto-updating agents: An additional 2 GB of storage should always be available on the machine for the agent to get auto-updated.

Note: Not meeting the above requirements may result in failure of agent installation/auto-update.

Software Requirement

PowerShell 3.0 or above must be installed on Windows.

Note:  PowerShell is required when deploying the agent in GUI mode. We are restricting the Agent versions to 4.0.1. So, partners should be using at least the 4.0.1 version moving forward.
