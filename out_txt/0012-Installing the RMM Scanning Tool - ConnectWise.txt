Overview

The RMM Scanning Tool allows you to:

Perform on-demand RMM desktop and server (where applicable) agent deployments to Windows, Mac, and Linux machines under your management.
Set up a schedule to scan and deploy agents to newly discovered systems on a network.
Update resources with agents installed to the latest agent version.
Prerequisites
Before the tool can be installed, an Asio Agent (desktop or server) belonging to a respective member and site must be installed on the machine running the RMM Scanning Tool.
As part of the installation process, the RMM Scanning Tool installer checks for the existence of Microsoft .Net Framework version 3.5 / 4.0 /4.5 on the machine. If Microsoft .Net Framework is not installed, download and install it from Microsoft before proceeding with setup.
The RMM Scanning Tool needs to run / launch with the system administrator privileges.
Mac machines: Remote Login must be enabled and can be found by browsing to: System Preferences > Sharing > Remote Login.
Application role permissions for Agent Management > RMM Scanning Tool Configuration > Install RMM Scanning Tool. 
User Access

The following default application roles have Agent Management permission for RMM Scanning Tool Configuration. To edit a custom application role and include RMM Scanning Tool Configuration, follow the steps to add permission to a role in ConnectWise Home > User and Application Settings > Application Roles.

Deployment Prerequisites

By default, the RMM Scanning Tool uses a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) call to check the status of an installed agent or to deploy the agent.

The WMI service should be in a running state on the target machine.
If a firewall is enabled on the target machine, the WMI service must be added to the firewall exclusion list.
File and Printer sharing services should be added to the firewall exclusion list. (This service is required only during the agent deployment process since WMI does not support file copy processes between two systems. To allow the file copy process to occur, the RMM Scanning Tool uses a Windows API that allows network resource connection and file copying).
WMI uses domain administrator credentials.
All systems marked for deployment must be ping-able from the system within the subnet where the RMM Scanning Tool is installed.
All systems marked for deployment must have the exclusions listed below (WMI service, file and printer sharing services) to ensure smooth deployment.
A user account with administrator privileges must be used for deployment. The user account can have local or domain privileges. Domain accounts should be in the format DOMAIN / USERNAME.
How to enable the RMM Scanning tool
Navigate to Endpoints > Devices page.
Select the endpoint where you want to install the RMM Scanning Tool.
From the Manage dropdown, select RMM Scanning Tool.

Select the checkbox on the RMM Scanning Configuration page to enable download and installation on the selected endpoint.

Click Save.
The RMM Scanning Tool automatically downloads and installs in the background on the selected endpoint.
Accessing and Using the RMM Scanning Tool

The RMM Scanning Tool can be accessed from your Start menu. Upon launching the RMM Scanning Tool, the following user interface is displayed:


Performing an On-Demand Scan

From the RMM scanning tool interface, you can perform a network scan and deploy agents to machines without agents when the scan completes. To perform a scan, follow these steps:

Scanning an IP range
Enter an IP range in the Start IP and End IP fields.

A user account with administrator privileges is required. The user account can be a local or domain account.

Enter the appropriate credentials in the Username and Password fields.

Click Start Scan to initiate the scan.

Scanning an IP subnet
To scan a subnet IP range, click Add Subnet and enter an additional IP range.
Enter the appropriate credentials in the Username and Password fields.
Select Start Scan to initiate the scan.

Column Data

When the scan is complete, the RMM Scanning Tool returns a list of resources found online, and the following columns populate with data:

Scanning Additional Subnets

To schedule an additional scan of the same subnet, keep the existing IP range in place and edit schedule details as needed. When scheduling, the Tool checks for any conflicts with already existing scans. If conflicts exist, they will be displayed. You can view a list of suggested additional scan schedules for the subnet if desired and can use the CTRL-C option to copy these schedules onto your clipboard before pasting them into a text editor and back into the schedule window.

Scheduling a Scan

To schedule a scan:

Enter an IP range in the Start IP and End IP fields and click on Add schedule details.

Select a scan frequency of Daily or Weekly in the Schedule Scan window.

Daily Scans: Set the Frequency drop-down to Daily and enter a date and time in the Start Time fields. To create a recurring scan, click the Recurrence check box and select a time interval from the Select drop-down menu. Select Custom and enter desired start times to create a custom scan interval. Up to two custom times can be specified. Click Save to create the schedule.

Weekly Scans: Set the Frequency drop-down to Weekly and select the days the scan will run. Next, enter a date and time in the Start Time fields. To create a recurring scan, click the Recurrence check box then select a time interval from the Select drop-down menu. Select Custom and enter desired start times to create a custom scan interval (up to two custom times can be specified). Click Save to create the schedule.
