Overview

The Clients tab in the ConnectWise Asio® platform allows you to create and manage your customers and information about them. This is where you can create companies and sites, which allow you to better organize the endpoints that you are managing with ConnectWise RMM™. 

Companies are overarching structures designed to encompass the entirety of your clients' organization. Sites are designed to be either physical or logical groupings within that organization.
