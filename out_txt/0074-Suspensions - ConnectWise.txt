Managing Quick Suspend Rules
Overview

Intelligent Alerts monitoring of ConnectWise RMM® provides out-of-the-box monitoring conditions that trigger a ticket on the endpoints when specific issues are detected. However, based on scenarios, you may want to temporarily or indefinitely stop the system from generating alerts. The alert suspension feature is useful to accommodate the suspension of alerts during periods of maintenance or testing.

User Access

Refer to Application Roles for more information about adding suspension permissions to a custom application role. The following users in the system will have access to the Suspension screen, enabling them to take appropriate actions for creating, updating, or deleting suspension rules.

Archiving of Suspension Rules

Suspension rules that have expired for more than 30 days will not be reflected in the listing screen. They will be available in a report only.

Intelligent Alerts Suspension Rules
Creating Intelligent Alerts Suspension Rule from the Suspension Section

Intelligent Alerts monitoring allows you to create suspension rules so that the system will not generate ticket notifications, and in turn, you will also not get emails or calls for the issue. 

Click on the Add Rule button and select Intelligent Alerts to open a window that allows you to create suspension rules.

Name: Add the appropriate name for the suspension rule to be created
Description: This section allows you to add information for other users to get more details on the suspension rule
Targeted Resources: This section allows you to select the target endpoints on which the suspension rule will be effective or applied. You can select sites, endpoints, or Dynamic Groups while creating the suspension rules. Selecting the option of all future sites will apply the suspension to current and all future sites as well. Clicking Select Targets opens a new window where you can select your resources based on type.
Schedule: This allows you to select the scheduled timeframe when the suspension should be effective. Select the Timezone first, select the start date/time, and the End date/time for the suspension rules. Start dates cannot be backdated values; they can be either current or future date/time
Note: The end date/time can also be selected as Never, which means that the suspension rules will never expire
Recurrence: This is an optional field and can be used only if recurring scheduled maintenance is needed for sites/endpoints or specific conditions are to be ignored at specific intervals. Recurrence can be set as days, weeks, or months.
For recurrence-based suspension rules, the Duration defined in the recurrence window will be used for suspending the rules on target endpoints. 
Suspended Alerts: This allows you to select the monitoring conditions that need to be suspended. You can either select specific monitoring conditions or family for suspensions. Conditions will be grouped by the family in the condition selector pop-up menu

For selecting conditions that offer additional configuration, like Low Disk Space, VMware Datastore, etc.

Click on the pencil icon.
Update the values.
Click OK.

Alerts will not be generated for conditions where the values match the alert generation request.

Suspension rules can be created only if the user has permission to create new rules. Users who do not have the create permission will not be allowed to create new suspension rules

Creating a Suspension rule from the Intelligent Alerts section

Users can also create suspension rules from the Intelligent Alerts section. This allows them to view additional details about the condition before deciding on creating suspension rules.

Navigate to the Alert Management > Intelligent Alerts
Select the monitoring conditions from the listing page and click on Suspension Rule.
The system will navigate you to the suspension creation page with the conditions selected from the previous page.

Editing Intelligent Alerts Suspension Rules

Rules created by users can be edited by users who have update permissions assigned to them. 

Note: If the suspension rule is created and assigned to multiple sites, then users who have permissions that are equal to or greater than the sites included in the suspension rules can edit the rules; otherwise, the user will see the rule as view only. 

To edit an existing rule, a user can click on the Suspension rule created from the list of rules displayed on the Suspension landing page. The Last updated information for the suspension rule will be displayed to the user. Any changes will be processed as an update, and the suspension rule will be modified to process the alerts accordingly.

Note: Any changes to suspension will be allowed at the current time, and a backdated start date/time will not be allowed.

Deleting Intelligent Alerts Suspension Rule

Suspension rules can be deleted from the system if they are no longer needed or relevant. You can delete suspension rules from the listing screen and from individual suspension rules by clicking on editing.

To delete the suspension rule from the listing screen, you need to select the rule and click Delete.

To delete an individual suspension rule, click on the suspension rule, which will take you to the edit page for the suspension rule. Click Delete.

Duplicating Intelligent Alerts Suspension Rule

Suspension rules can be duplicated in case you do not want to edit an existing rule defined in the system. To duplicate the suspension rule, click on the suspension rule and click Duplicate.

Note: Duplicating suspension will be allowed for users who have Create permissions only. 

Duplicating the suspension rule will retain the target resources and conditions selected for the suspension. You need to update the schedule information (Start date/time and End date/time) for the new suspension rule. Duplicating the suspension rule will also add a prefix of "copy of" to the existing suspension rule name, but it can be edited as needed.

Custom Monitor Suspension Rule
Creating Custom Monitor Suspension Rule

A suspension rule against monitors needs to be created to prevent Custom Monitors from triggering tickets during a specific window. 

Click on the Add Rule button and select Custom Monitors to open the window that allows you to create suspension rules.

Name: Add the appropriate name for the suspension rule to be created.
Description: This section allows you to add information for other users to get more details on the suspension rule.
Target Resources: This allows you to select the target endpoint on which the suspension rule will be effective or applied. You can select sites, endpoints, or Dynamic Groups while creating the suspension rules. Selecting the option of all future sites will apply the suspension to all current and future sites as well.
Schedule: This allows you to select the scheduled timeframe when the suspension should be effective. Select the Timezone first. Next, select the start date/time and End date/time for the suspension rules. Start dates cannot be backdated values; they can be either current or a future date/time.
Note: The End date/time can also be selected as Never, which means that the suspension rules will never expire.
Recurrence: This is an optional field and can only be used if recurring scheduled maintenance is needed for sites/endpoints or specific conditions are to be ignored at specific intervals. Recurrence can be set as days, weeks, or months.
For recurrence-based suspension rules, the duration defined in the recurrence window will be used for suspending the rules on target endpoints. 
Suspended Alerts: This allows you to select the custom monitors that need to be suspended. You can either select a specific type of monitor or individual monitors for suspensions. Monitors created will be grouped by type in the condition selector pop-up menu

Suspension rules can be created only if the user has permission to create new rules. Users who do not have the create permission will not be allowed to create new suspension rules

Editing Custom Monitor Suspension Rule

Rules created by users can be edited by any users who have update permissions assigned to them. 

Note: If the suspension rule is created and assigned to multiple sites, users who have permissions equal to or greater than those of the sites included in the suspension rules can edit the rule; otherwise, the user will see the rule as view only. 

To edit an existing rule, a user can click on the Suspension rule created from the list of rules displayed on the Suspension landing page. The last updated information for the suspension rule will be displayed to the user. Any changes will be processed as an update, and the suspension rule will be modified to process the alerts accordingly.

Note: Any changes to suspension will be allowed at the current time and; hence, a backdated start date/time will not be allowed.

Deleting Custom Monitor Suspension Rule

Suspension rules can be deleted from the system if they are no longer needed or relevant. Deleting suspension rules can be performed from the listing screen as well as from individual suspension rules by clicking on editing.

Alerts created will be grouped by type in the condition selector pop-up menu. To learn more about which monitoring conditions have the default automation set to 'Enabled', review this documentation.


Important:

In the case of the Default Automation Suspension Rule, the default automation suspension suspends only the default automation execution and not the monitoring.
Suspension rules can be created only if the user has permission to do so. Users who do not have the create permission will not be allowed to create new suspension rules.
Editing Default Automation Suspension Rule

Rules created by users can be edited by any users who have update permissions assigned to them. 

Note: If the suspension rule is created and assigned to multiple sites, users who have permissions equal to or greater than those of the sites included in the suspension rules can edit the rule; otherwise, the user will see the rule as view only.

To edit an existing rule, a user can click on the Suspension rule created from the list of rules displayed on the Suspension landing page. The last updated information for the suspension rule will be displayed to the user. Any changes will be processed as an update, and the suspension rule will be modified to process the alerts accordingly.

Note: Any changes to suspension will be allowed at the current time and; hence, a backdated start date/time will not be allowed.

Deleting Default Automation Suspension Rule

Suspension rules can be deleted from the system if they are no longer needed or relevant. Deleting suspension rules can be performed from the listing screen as well as from individual suspension rules by clicking on editing.

To delete the suspension rule from the listing screen, select it and click the Delete button.

To delete an individual suspension rule, click on the suspension rule, which will take you to the edit page for the suspension rule. Click Delete.

Duplicating Default Automation Suspension Rule

Suspension rules can be duplicated in case you do not want to edit an existing rule defined in the system. In order to duplicate the suspension rule, click on the suspension rule and click on the duplicate button.

Note: Duplicating suspension will only be allowed for users who have create permissions.

Duplicating the suspension rule will retain the resource selected and the conditions selected for the suspension. The user needs to update the schedule information (Start date/time and End date/time) for the new suspension rule. A prefix of "copy of" will be added to the existing suspension rule name, but can be edited as needed.

Quick Suspend

Quick suspend allows you to create quick suspension rules for any immediate need of maintenance for the endpoint right from the devices page. Quick suspend will suspend all monitoring conditions available for a required duration.

Navigation Path

The quick suspend option is available under the Devices page. 

Endpoints > Devices > Select the server (Click on the name) > Quick Suspend

Note: The Quick Suspend button will be visible only to users who have permission to create new suspension rules in the system. 

Creating Quick Suspension

Clicking on the Quick Suspend button will open a modal popup allowing you to provide the duration for the Suspension rule creation.

The Timezone will be preselected on the modal popup; however, you can change the values based on your requirements.

The Start Date/Time and End Date/Time will be preselected (the difference is 6 hours by default). Both times can be edited based on your requirements.

Clicking on the save button will save the suspension rule with the naming convention as "Quick Suspend for <<Endpoint_Name>>". Endpoint_Name will be replaced as per the resource selected for the suspension.

Managing Quick Suspend Rules
