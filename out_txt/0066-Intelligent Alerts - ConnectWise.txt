Overview

ConnectWise RMM™ intelligent alerts are a plug-and-play monitoring system that automatically applies predefined conditions based on the endpoint type (server, desktop, etc.). 

When the ConnectWise RMM agent is installed on an endpoint, the agent performs an automatic scan to identify active services, open ports, and running processes. Based on this scan and the RMM product package in use (Core, Standard, or Premium), the system applies a tailored set of intelligent alerts. 

Please refer to Intelligent Alerts Conditions for more detailed information about each condition.

Manage Intelligent Alerts

The Intelligent Alerts page provides centralized visibility and control over monitoring conditions across endpoints, companies, and sites. You can access this feature from multiple areas of the platform, each offering a different scope of visibility.

Note: The displayed alert data is context-sensitive based on the navigation path. However, automations, mappings, and monitor output settings are global—changes made in Edit Intelligent Alert apply across all applicable endpoints and devices.

Configuration and Output

Each alert condition is pre-configured based on endpoint type. You can set up automated tasks within the Edit Intelligent Alert window. Changes made in Edit Intelligent Alert apply to all applicable endpoints and devices.

Automation Tasks

Follow the steps below to configure an automation task for an intelligent alert:

Navigate to Endpoints > Alerts > Intelligent Alerts.
Click the condition name in the Intelligent Alert list view.

In the Automation pod, click Add Automation.

Search for and select the task you want to enable for this condition. If you do not have an automation for this condition yet, you can create one in Automation > Tasks and then return here to select it. Please note the following about automations:
The list of available automations is populated based on your permissions.
Users with permissions to create automation tasks can save the automation for the monitoring condition.
The system displays automation tasks that do not require parameters. Please refer to these out-of-the-box (OOTB) automation tasks for parameterized scripts. All custom scripts/tasks created are available for selection.

Click Select. 
Click Select Targets to identify the specific resources this automation applies to.

Sort endpoints by Companies, Sites, Device Groups, Devices, or All Resources using the radio buttons at the top. 
Use checkboxes to select endpoints. 
Tip: Selecting from Device Groups can help narrow down device types and preferences. This task applies to all future devices added to the device group.
Click Save Selection.
Click Save to finish editing the alert configuration.

Intelligent Alert Mapper

Note: This feature is applicable only for partners using ConnectWise PSA with Policies.

The mapper functionality allows you to associate each Intelligent Alert—whether configurable or non-configurable—with specific attributes such as Service Board, Type, Sub-Type, and Item. This mapping enables differentiated handling of alerts based on monitoring conditions.

Enable the Mapper

Note: This functionality requires Alert Management - Intelligent Alert > Mapper permissions. Refer to the Intelligent Alerts permission comparison for more information.

By default, the Mapper toggle is turned off. To activate it:

Switch the Mapper toggle on. 
Select the values from the drop-down. These selections override the PSA policy configuration. 

Mapper Field Descriptions

This feature is applicable only for partners using ConnectWise PSA with Policies.

Type, Sub-Type, Item

	

Type → Sub-Type → Item: These fields are interdependent.

Selecting a Type filters the available Sub-Types.
Selecting a Sub-Type filters the available Items.
Example: Choosing Tier 1 as the Type shows Sub-Types associated with Tier 1 only.



Priority

	

Override the system's default ticket priority.




Creation Status

	

Override the system's default creation status.




Closure Status

	

Select one of the predefined statuses created by the RMM-PSA integration.

Please note that only statuses marked as Closed appear in the drop-down menu.

Monitor Output

The Monitor Output functionality lets you control ticket generation behavior for intelligent alerts. 

To select your ticket preference:

Navigate to Endpoints > Alerts > Intelligent Alerts.
Click on the Alert condition from the list that you want to turn ticket generation on/off for.
In the Monitor Output section, click the Output drop-down.
Select from the following options:
Generate Ticket: A ticket is created immediately when the alert condition is met.
Generate Ticket with Delay: A ticket is created after a specified delay (5-60 minutes). If the issue is resolved before the delay expires, no ticket is generated.
Do Not Generate Ticket: No ticket is created, but the alert and any associated automations are still executed.

Note: The Generate Ticket with Delay option is available for conditions with a closing condition. For other conditions, only the options Generate Ticket and Do not Generate Ticket are visible. In case of alert threshold conditions, the Monitor Output value applies to all the thresholds configured.
