Monitor Types 
Overview

ConnectWise RMM® allows you to create custom alert monitors using a variety of available monitor templates. Monitors use these templates to trigger alerts when issues are identified based on various values that are collected from the endpoint. These alerts are generated in near real-time to notify of problems observed.

Please refer to these different types of Custom Monitors for more detailed information about each monitor.

Note: Custom Monitors are available in ACR for partners to import or export. Monitors will get exported or imported to ACR without target and Associated Automation. For more information, review the ConnectWise Community Exchange article.

User Access

Refer to Application Roles for more information about adding alert monitor permissions to a custom application role. The following default roles have access to the monitor screen for viewing the existing monitors or creating a new monitor:

Manage Custom Monitors

The Monitors page provides centralized visibility and control over monitoring conditions across endpoints, companies, and sites. You can access this feature from multiple areas of the platform, each offering a different scope of visibility.

Note: The displayed alert data is context-sensitive based on the navigation path. However, automations, mappings, and monitor output settings are global; changes made in Edit Monitor apply across all applicable endpoints and devices.

Changes made in Edit Monitor apply across all applicable endpoints and devices.
From this view, you can also manage Intelligent Alerts and Suspension for the company level.

Endpoint Monitoring Conditions

After the agent is installed on a device, you can access a detailed view of custom monitors specific to that endpoint. To learn more, refer to the Descriptions sections below.

 Navigate to Endpoints > Devices > Device Detail > Monitoring > Custom Monitors to view this page.

This page provides a highly targeted view of alerting behavior and automation for the selected endpoint. Technicians and users with access to Custom Monitors can:

Configuration and Output

Each monitor can be configured according to the endpoint type. You can set up automated tasks within the Edit Monitor window. Changes made in Edit Monitor apply to all applicable endpoints and devices.

Automation Tasks

Follow the steps below to configure an automation task for a custom monitor:

Navigate to Endpoints > Alerts > Monitors.
Click the monitor name in the Monitors list view.

In the Automation pod, click Add Automation.

Search for and select the task you want to enable for this condition. If you do not have an automation for this condition yet, you can create one in Automation > Tasks and then return here to select it. Please note the following about automations:
The list of available automations is populated based on your permissions.
Users with permissions to create automation tasks can save the automation for the monitoring condition.
The system displays automation tasks that do not require parameters. Please refer to these out-of-the-box (OOTB) automation tasks for parameterized scripts. All custom scripts/tasks created are available for selection.

Click Select.
Custom Monitors Mapper

Important: This feature is only applicable to partners using ConnectWise PSA with Policies.

The mapper functionality allows you to associate each Custom Monitor with specific attributes such as Service Board, Type, Sub-Type, and Item. This mapping enables differentiated handling of custom monitors.

Enable the Mapper

Note: This functionality requires Custom Monitors > Mapper permissions. Refer to the Monitors permission comparison for more information.

By default, the Mapper toggle is turned off. To activate it:

Switch the Mapper toggle on. 
Select the values from the drop-down. These selections override the PSA policy configuration. 

Mapper Field Descriptions

This feature is applicable only for partners using ConnectWise PSA with Policies.

Field

	

Description




Service Board

	

Set the service board to which the ticket is routed upon creation.




Type, Sub-Type, Item

	

Type → Sub-Type → Item: These fields are interdependent.

Selecting a Type filters the available Sub-Types.

Selecting a Sub-Type filters the available Items.

Example: Choosing Tier 1 as the Type shows Sub-Types associated with Tier 1 only.




Priority

	

Override the system's default ticket priority.




Creation Status

	

Override the system's default creation status.




Closure Status

	

Select one of the predefined statuses created by the RMM-PSA integration.

Please note that only statuses marked as Closed appear in the drop-down menu.

 

Monitor Output

The Monitor Output functionality enables you to control the ticket generation behavior for custom monitors.

To select your ticket preference:

Navigate to Endpoints > Alerts > Monitors.
Click on the monitor from the list that you want to turn ticket generation on/off for.
In the Monitor Output section, click the Monitor Output drop-down.

Select from the following options:
Generate Ticket: A ticket is created immediately when the alert condition set for the Custom Monitor is met.
Generate Ticket with Delay: A ticket is created after a specified delay (5-60 minutes). If the issue is resolved before the delay expires, no ticket is generated.
Do Not Generate Ticket: No ticket is created, but the alert and any associated automations are still executed.

Note:

The Generate Ticket with Delay option is available for conditions with a closing condition. For other conditions, only the options Generate Ticket and Do not Generate Ticket are visible. In case of alert threshold conditions, the Monitor Output value applies to all the thresholds configured.
If you have selected the Generate ticket with delay option, then it overrides the Ticket update - Snooze for configuration, and the ticket gets updated with ticket notes based on updates.
Alert Created as a Trigger in Asio Workflows

You can configure workflows in ConnectWise Asio® to trigger when an Alert is created for selected monitor types or individual monitors. This gives you more control over how alerts are handled and allows you to define actions that follow alert generation.

The trigger supports both broad and specific configurations:

Select a Monitor Type (e.g., Disk, Event) to apply the workflow across all monitors of that type.
Or choose Individual Monitors for more targeted workflows.

This setup enables you to link alert generation to various actions, such as notifications or integrations, based on your operational preferences.

Trigger Details
Trigger Name: Alert Created
Available for:
Monitor Types: Disk, Event, Application, Device Availability, Service
Individual Monitors: Specific monitors can be selected for above mentioned types

When this trigger is used, the workflow executes whenever an alert is generated for the selected monitor type or individual monitor.

If a Monitor type is selected, the workflow applies to all monitors under that type.
If Individual monitors are selected, the workflow only applies to that monitor.
Use Case

You can create a workflow with an alert generated as a trigger and associate other notification channels instead of tickets.

For example, you can associate an email notification with an alert trigger, and when the workflow is triggered, you receive an email for alert generation.

In the Asio workflow screen, from the Trigger side-panel, you need to select Alerts and click Continue, as shown here:

On the next screen, you have the option to select from the available monitor types or from the individual monitor options.

Note: This functionality is supported on all monitor types except Complex Monitor.
