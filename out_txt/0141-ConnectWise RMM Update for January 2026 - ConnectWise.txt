API Migration: V1 to V2 Transition

In the past, when partners accessed ConnectWise Asio® data for endpoints, each device used a public identifier as its unique reference. However, these IDs wouldn’t match the data exposed to them via ConnectWise PSA™ (Manage), Asio console, Snowflake Syndication, Reports and Dashboards (formerly BrightGauge™), etc., which would cause confusion. 

Hence, to ensure consistency in the system for device identifiers, we have now made sure that every system or solution connected to Asio will use a common identifier (Private IDs).  

To support this change, we have migrated several APIs from V1 to V2 to align with the new framework and improve consistency across services.  

For partners who have stored or maintained the device's data, we will add an additional API that allows you to retrieve Public-to-Private or vice versa to support this transition. 

Note: Not all API endpoints have changed from V1 to V2, and some can continue to operate or be functional. Older API endpoints that are updated will be deprecated soon.

Key Details

Endpoint IDs shared with partners will now be private (public-to-private mapping is discontinued). 
A conversion API is available under Devices on the developer portal to help update integrations: 
Convert private → public and public → private endpoint IDs. 
Partners must update their systems to use only private endpoint IDs going forward.

Migration Guidance

Stop using public endpoint IDs in all API calls. 
Use the conversion API under Devices on the developer portal to update your systems: 
Convert public → private and private → public IDs as needed during migration. 
Update all integrations to consume only V2 APIs.

Developer Portal Links

The following link provides access to all API Swagger specifications, including both V1 and V2:

Partner APIs: https://developer.connectwise.com/Products/ConnectWise_Asio/Asio_Vendors/APIs_and_Callbacks/REST_API

Timeline

Complete migration by April 30, 2026. 
Start consuming V2 APIs immediately. 
V1 APIs and Legacy Reporting APIs will be deprecated by April 30, 2026.
New Guide – Configuring DUO TOTP for Help Desk Services User Administration

We have published a new guide that walks you through configuring a DUO Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) account specifically for Help Desk Services (HDS). This configuration enables HDS to securely perform user administration tasks in DUO on behalf of your organization.

Why this matters
Partners can now rely on a standardized, documented process for setting up DUO access for HDS. This helps:

Ensure secure and compliant DUO user administration by HDS.
Reduce onboarding time when enabling HDS to support DUO.
Minimize configuration errors and support delays.

What’s included in the guide
The documentation covers:

Prerequisites to enable DUO user administration by HDS.
Step‑by‑step instructions to configure a DUO TOTP account for HDS.
Recommended settings and considerations for security and access control.
How to validate that HDS can successfully manage users in DUO.

Access the guide here: Help Desk Services - DUO User Administration

Upcoming Change: Auto-Closure of Inactive Help Desk and NOC Tickets

Expert Services is planning to introduce an automatic closure process for inactive Help Desk tickets and reinforce the existing auto-closure process for NOC tickets. The details are as below. 

Note: This change applies only to accounts with ConnectWise Help Desk Services™ and ConnectWise NOC Services™.

What’s Changing?

Starting January 19, 2026, tickets that meet specific criteria will be automatically closed after a defined period of inactivity:

Help Desk tickets will auto-close after 365 days of inactivity.
NOC tickets will auto-close after 30 days of inactivity (as originally intended).

This update ensures consistency and helps maintain an efficient and responsive support environment.

Which Tickets Will Be Auto-Closed?

Tickets will be auto-closed if:

They are assigned to partners for a site with Help Desk or NOC enabled.
The ticket is not already closed.
The ticket did not originate from an alert.
There have been no updates for:
365 days (Help Desk)
30 days (NOC)

When a ticket is auto-closed, the following notification displays:

"This ticket has been closed due to inactivity. If further action is needed, please create a new ticket."

Note: This change is planned for release on January 19, 2026.

Important Impact for Partners with Both NOC and Help Desk Services

Historically, NOC tickets did not auto-close after 30 days as intended. With this release, partners who have both Help Desk and NOC services will see NOC tickets begin closing after 30 days of inactivity. This may result in older NOC tickets being closed automatically going forward.

RMM Site Enablement

Starting January 29, 2026, RMM Products and Capabilities will only be available on machines through the RMM Site Configuration policy. To maintain RMM capabilities, ensure the RMM Site Configuration policy is enabled at the sites. Refer to RMM Site Enablement for details on the impact of not enabling this policy.

Note:

This change will take effect for partners in the European region only.
These changes are currently live in the Australian region.
For North America, the effective date would be communicated later.

The Community Exchange, built on the Asio platform, is now live for all the RMM Essentials, RMM Pro, and RMM Premium partners. Community Exchange is a purpose-built hub where MSPs, Technical Service Providers, and small and mid-sized partners can install, upload, and share production-ready content across communities and partners. See more details on the Community Exchange docs homepage.
