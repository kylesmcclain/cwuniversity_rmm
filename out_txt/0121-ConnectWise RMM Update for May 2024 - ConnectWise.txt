Overview 

This page provides information on the latest enhancements and features for ConnectWise RMM.

Announcements 
ConnectWise PSA - Integration via policies 

This is a final reminder about an important update regarding RMM integration with ConnectWise PSA.

On June 15th, 2024 we will be retiring our Legacy PSA Configuration for Manage. To ensure uninterrupted sync with ConnectWise PSA and to take full advantage of our latest enhancement, we strongly encourage you to explore and adopt the improved RMM and ConnectWise PSA sync configurations that could be integrated using policies.

This is your last opportunity to act before the Legacy PSA Configuration is deprecated. Ticket, configuration item, and notifications for sync failure would be disabled unless ConnectWise PSA Policies are not enabled.

Autotask PSA - Integration via policies

We will be adding an option for partners to enable the Autotask PSA sync configurations that defines Ticket, Configuration item, and Contacts using policies. These policies can be included in the packages and applied to the sites using the package assignment option.

The Policy improvement will have additional features like Syncing Friendly Name to Autotask PSA. With the newer integration, you will have the option to select custom note types in Inward and Outward Note Type Sync.

There will be no migration performed for the existing configuration, but the policies will take effect if they are assigned or applied to a site. You will initially have a toggle button to either enable or disable the policies-based configuration and continue using the old method for now.

We will completely stop supporting the older configuration method by May 1st, 2024.

In Console Reports in the Asio Platform

Asio reporting will be improved to ensure consistency in data across the Asio platform and Reporting pages. This enhancement will apply to the following reports this month:
