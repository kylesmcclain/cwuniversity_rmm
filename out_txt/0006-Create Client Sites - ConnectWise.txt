Agents

Agent management is available from the Company or Site Detail page. For more information on agent management, refer to the Download and Install Agents documentation.

Uninstall Agents from Company or Site Details 

To uninstall selective endpoints from a company or site, select the company from the Company List. All agents deployed to site endpoints are available from this page. To isolate site-specific endpoints, select a company and then select a site from the Site List. Follow the steps below to uninstall the agent from an endpoint:

Click the Agents tab.

Click the Agent Management tab.
Select the checkbox for the endpoint.
Click Uninstall Agent(s).

The Uninstall Agent window displays the list of selected devices. Only the devices without references are selected to run the uninstall. Review the list and deselect incorrect devices, if any.

A red icon  indicates that the endpoint has references or other devices monitored via the endpoint, and it is automatically deselected. The uninstall action cannot be performed on this endpoint until the other devices are removed by a Technician or authorized user.  

After you have verified the devices and removed references, you must provide a reason for the uninstall. Select a reason from the drop-down menu to enable the Uninstall Agent(s) button.

Click Uninstall Agent(s).
Click Confirm to proceed.

A confirmation message is displayed to indicate that the uninstall job has been scheduled. Upon confirmation, if the endpoint is reporting online, the job has not been executed in the data center yet and is scheduled. If the endpoint is reporting offline or not communicating with the data center, the request is maintained in the backend to process for up to 360 days. The device must be online to perform the agent uninstall job. 

Note: When uninstalling RMM agents, remember to also uninstall any Webroot agents on the device that may be installed to avoid being billed on the next billing cycle for Webroot licenses not in use.

Monitoring
Custom Monitors

Click Monitoring > Custom Monitors on the Company Detail or Site Detail page to view custom monitors applied to the company or site. Custom Monitors are applied based on the conditions created in the Custom Monitor section of RMM, located under Endpoints > Alerts > Monitors.


Click the name of the custom monitor to open the Edit Monitor page, where you can designate the output, targeted resources, and details of the custom monitor. Refer to Custom Monitors for more information.

Intelligent Alerts

After the agent is installed for a device associated with an Asio company, you can navigate to the company detail page and manage the intelligent alert monitoring conditions for all endpoints within the company. To learn more, refer to Intelligent Alert Configuration.

Navigate to Clients > Companies > [select a company] > Monitoring > Intelligent Alerts

To manage at the site level, first select a company and then select the site. From the site detail page, click Monitoring > Intelligent Alerts.
Click the condition name to customize alert actions, such as automation or ticket generation.
Changes made in Edit Intelligent Alert apply across all applicable endpoints and devices.
From this view, you can also manage Suspension and Custom Monitors for the company level.

Suspensions

Suspension rules are created in Endpoints > Alerts > Suspensions. Suspensions can apply to Intelligent Alerts, Custom Monitors, and Automation for a specified window. If applicable to the selected resource, suspensions appear on this page.

Contacts can be created for both Companies and Sites. The company's primary contact can only be assigned when creating a new contact.
