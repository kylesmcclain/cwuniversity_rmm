Overview

Hyper-V Monitors allow you to define Hyper-V Host and Hyper-V Guest data for monitoring on a target endpoint. 

How to create a Hyper-V Host Availability Monitor

Navigate to  Endpoints > Alerts > Monitors.

Click Add Monitor.

Provide a Name for the new monitor. Optionally you can provide a Description of your new monitor.

Select the Type as Hyper-V from the drop-down for creating the appropriate monitor.

Select the Family and Severity from the drop-down menus.

To enable the Mapper functionality, you need to turn on the toggle. To learn more about the Mapper functionality review this documentation.

Under the Condition section,
Machine Type: This allows you to select the Machine Type as Host or VM. For host-based monitoring, select the value from the dropdown as Host.
Duration: Select the duration for which the host is not running.
You can also select a custom Automation Task to be executed when the condition is met on the endpoint.

Note: System will reflect only selective Automation tasks that do not need parameters. Refer these OOTB tasks which needs parameters. All Custom Scripts created will be available for selection.

Under the Ticket Resolution section you can define if the ticket should be updated as Resolved once the following criteria is met:

Machine Type: Select Host.

Under the Resources section, you can select the target endpoints on which the alerts should be triggered. You can select specific machines, Sites, or a Dynamic or a Static group.

Click Save to create and apply the monitor to the targets.

How to create a Hyper-V Guest/VM Monitor

Navigate to Endpoints > Alerts > Monitors.

Click Add Monitor.

Provide a Name for the new monitor. Optionally you can provide a Description of your new monitor.

Select the Type as Hyper-V from the drop-down for creating the appropriate monitor.

Select the Family and Severity from the drop-down menus.

To enable the Mapper functionality, you need to turn on the toggle. To learn more about the Mapper functionality review this documentation.

Under the Condition section:
Machine Type: This allows you to select the Machine Type as Host or VM. For guest based monitoring, select the value from dropdown as VM
Monitoring Type: Select the type of monitoring you want:
State Monitoring: Select the state monitoring of the VM.
Condition: Select the state of the VM.
Running: This allows you to define the condition for the VM as Running for triggering an alert.
Not Running: This allows you to define the condition for the VM as Not Running for triggering an alert.
Replication State: Select the Replication state of the VM.
Condition: This allows you to define the condition of the Replication state of the VM.
Equals: This means the condition of the replication state to be equal to a value.
Not Equals: This allows you to define the condition of replication state to not equal a value.
Values: This allows you to define the replication state values from the list.
The following replication states are supported:
Disabled
Ready for replication
Waiting to complete initial replication
Replicating
Synced replication complete
Recovered
Committed
Suspended
Critical
Waiting to start resynchronization
Resynchronizing
Resynchronization suspended
Failover in progress
Failback in progress
Failback complete
Number of Checkpoints: This allows you to define the number of checkpoints for the VM.
 Condition: This allows you to define the condition of the checkpoints for the VM.
Above: This allows you to define the condition for the checkpoints to be Above a specific value.
Below:  This allows you to define the condition for the checkpoints to be below a specific value.
Equals to: This allows you to define the condition for the checkpoints to be equal to a specific value.
Checkpoint size: This allows you to define the checkpoint size for VMs (This will be the size of each Checkpoint.)
Condition: This allows you to define the condition of the checkpoint's size of the VM.
Above: This allows you to define the condition for the size of the checkpoint to be Above a specific value.
Below:  This allows you to define the condition for the size of the checkpoint to be below a specific value.
Value: This allows you to define the value that should be used for triggering the alert
Unit: This allows you to define the values for the Unit to be used for comparing
MB: This allows you to set the values in MB  
GB: This allows you set the values in GB
You can also select a custom Automation Task to be executed when the condition is met on the endpoint

Note: System will reflect only selective Automation tasks that do not need parameters. Refer these OOTB tasks which needs parameters. All Custom Scripts created will be available for selection.

Under the Ticket Resolution section you can define if the ticket should be updated as Resolved once the following criteria is met:

Machine Type: This allows you to select the Machine Type as Host or VM. For guest based monitoring, select the value from the dropdown as VM
Monitoring Type: Select the type of monitoring you want:
State Monitoring: Select the state monitoring of the VM.
Condition: Select the state of the VM.
Running: This allows you to define the condition for the VM as Running for triggering an alert.
Not Running: This allows you to define the condition for the VM as Not Running for triggering an alert.
Replication State: Select the Replication state of the VM.
Condition: This allows you to define the condition of the Replication state of the VM.
Equals: This means the condition of the replication state to be equal to a value.
Not Equals: This allows you to define the condition of replication state to not equal a value.
Values: This allows you to define the replication state values from the list.
The following replication states are supported:
Disabled
Ready for replication
Waiting to complete initial replication
Replicating

Below:  This allows you to define the condition for the checkpoints to be below a specific value.
Equals to: This allows you to define the condition for the checkpoints to be equal to a specific value.
Checkpoint size: This allows you to define the checkpoint size for VMs (This will be the sum of all Checkpoints).
Condition: This allows you to define the condition of the checkpoint's size of the VM.
Above: This allows you to define the condition for the size of the checkpoint to be Above a specific value.
Below:  This allows you to define the condition for the size of the checkpoint to be below a specific value.
Value: This allows you to define the value that should be used for triggering the alert
Unit: This allows you to define the values for the Unit to be used for comparing
MB: This allows you to set the values in MB  
GB: This allows you set the values in GB
You can also select a custom Automation Task to be executed when the condition is met on the endpoint

Under the Resources section, you can select the target endpoints on which the alerts should be triggered. You can select specific machines, Sites, or a Dynamic or a Static group. You must select a Hyper-V host, otherwise, the monitor will not trigger an alert.

Click Save to create and apply the monitor to the targets.

Note:

For Virtual machine monitoring, the alert will be generated for machines where the agent is installed.

For Virtual machine checkpoint-size monitoring, the alert will be generated for each snapshot separately.

For the monitor to work correctly, a metric in the condition section needs to be the same as in the resolution section, otherwise, an alert will not be generated.

 

Note: Monitors will be triggered based on the configuration set/defined.
