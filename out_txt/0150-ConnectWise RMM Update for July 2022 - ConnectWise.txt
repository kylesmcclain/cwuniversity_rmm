Task Changes and Updates

This month we will begin a staged partner-by-partner migration that will take effect through July 30th. You will not see any changes until you have been migrated. Migrations will occur during off-hours and, on average, take two minutes to complete. You will receive a notification in the Asio Platform (ITSupport Portal) letting you know that your migration has been completed.

 

Changes to Scheduled Task behavior

 

Completed Tasks (a Task that has been scheduled to Run and an Outcome has been reported for all computers after the Task's final scheduled execution) can no longer be edited. This change was made last month in preparation for backend changes this month that will improve the stability and reliability of Scheduled Tasks.

Any Scheduled Task that combines a repeating schedule with a trigger, or combines multiple triggers, will be split into multiple Scheduled Tasks. Beginning this month, you can no longer combine a repeating schedule with a trigger, or combine multiple triggers in a single Scheduled Task. However, you can create multiple Scheduled Tasks to achieve the same results.

Scheduled Tasks that use Local Machine Time will fail to run when scheduled to start in the past for any device.

Example: If you are in Central Standard time and support clients in both Central and Eastern Standard Time, and at 4pm CST, you schedule a Task to run once today at 4:15pm Local Machine Time, this Scheduled Task will fail because it is scheduled to start in the past for devices in Eastern Timezone, as it is already 5pm EST.

Scheduled Task History will now group device execution by Local Machine Time.

Example: If you are in Central Standard time and support clients in both Central and Eastern Standard Time, and at 4pm CST, you schedule a Task to run once today at 4:15pm Local Machine Time, the Scheduled Task History will show two records, one for CST and one for EST.

Any instance of a Scheduled Task with a Start Time of more than 72 hours ago will show as Failed for devices that have not completed executing the Task.

Scheduled Tasks that are active, but could not previously be seen, will become visible.

 

UI Changes when scheduling a Task

 

Run Time will be merged with Start Time. Any partner looking for Run Time should use Start Time.

End Time will be removed and all new or updated Scheduled Tasks will use 23:59:59 as their End Time.

Always will be removed as an option for Triggers and is now considered the default behavior for Triggers.

Partners will be able to schedule Tasks for Sites and Dynamic Groups that are currently empty (they have no resources in them). If the Site or Dynamic Group is still empty at the scheduled Start Time, the Scheduled Task will fail.

ConnectWise RMM
Automation

We've added the ability to create Script Parameters. You can now create Script Parameters and define them when scheduling the Script, similar to what you can do today when scheduling an Action. This will be release on July 22nd.

Note: Script Parameters are called by using the @ sign before and after the Parameter name. Meaning parameter Demo 1 can be called using @Demo 1@.

Communicator

Scripts from Communicator. You can now assign Scripts to the Communicator menu for end-users to execute. A new menu option for Custom scripts will available in Policies to select any existing Scripts.

The tasks name shown in the menu can be defined in Policy to make it easier for end-users to identify the action performed by the task

Separate Tray Icon for MacOS. You can now set a different Icon for macOS so that it appears different from Windows icon in the tray.

Intune Integration

Intune Integration using a CSP Account. Support for Intune Integration using a Cloud Solution Provider(CSP) account will be enabled with this release, in addition to the existing direct tenant integration. Both direct tenant and CSP account integrations will now be supported using the Client Credentials flow which requires Application permissions model . Therefore, all existing single tenant MS Intune integrations will be disabled with this release. You are requested to setup their integrations by looking up the latest documentation on Doc Center.

This means that you can choose to integrate any of the following:

One or more single/direct tenant integrations

One or more CSP Account integrations

One or more single/direct tenant and one or more CSP Account integrations

This will be released to production in the first week of August.

Note: Support for Intune Information and the Intune Flyout on the Devices Summary page using CSP account integration will also be enabled with this release. Both Direct Tenant and CSP Account integrations will continue to support all features developed for the integration

Monitoring

SMART Disk monitoring alert to be moved to General Availability. The SMART disk monitor which is currently available as a preview alert will now be enabled as a General availability. SMART issues observed on disk will not trigger a corresponding ticket for workstation and servers. This will be released on August 6th.

IntelliMon Alerts Customization feature added. We are adding a new feature where the Default IntelliMon alert configuration for specific conditions can be modified and applied to specific endpoints, sites, or Dynamic or Static Groups. This will allow you to edit the default alert configurations for the alert generation. Thresholds applied will override the default alert configurations. This will be released on August 6th.

You can also apply individual automation rules against the thresholds.

Monitor for custom fields. We are adding a new capability for adding a custom monitor to generate an alert in the system when values are updated in a custom field. Based on the criteria defined for the monitor, we will trigger an alert and execute corresponding automation if defined. This will be released on August 1st.

SNMP monitor. We are adding a new capability for adding an SNMP monitor to generate an alert in the system against the newly added SNMP devices.

The SNMP Monitor can be applied for the following criterias:

Device availability

OID monitoring

Alerts will be generated based on the data received from the endpoints for changes against the SNMP devices. The initial release will cover for the SNMP v1 and v2 devices only and it will be available by August 5th. We will extend the functionality to support SNMP v3 devices later in August.

Device Availability:

OID Monitoring:

Interface to add new SNMP Devices to monitoring. We are adding additional features on the current Virtualization Monitoring page to extend and support the addition of SNMP devices to monitoring. You will be able to add SNMP devices which supports v1 and v2 on August 1st. You will be able to add SNMP devices that support v3 by mid August.

Patching

New Patching Alert Conditions. We will be making the following Patching alert conditions live.

OS Patching Assessment Failure (Desktop)

OS Patching Assessment Failure (Server)

OS Patching Endpoint Never Assessed

Any suspensions created when the conditions were under Preview Alerts will be considered when the conditions go live. These will be released on July 28th.

New OS Patching Reports. We have released the following new Reports, Gauges and Dataset in BrightGauge.

Dataset

OS Patch Assessment - Windows

Gauges

Missing Windows OS Patches By Endpoints V2.0

Missing Windows OS Patches By Classification V2.0

Installed Windows OS Patches By Classification V2.0

Installed Windows OS Patches By Endpoints V2.0

Reports

Installed Updates Report V2.0

Missing Updates Report V2.0

Portal

Agent Update. An agent update, version 2.1.803, will be rolled out in phased manner starting August 1st.

Reporting

New Agent Report in BrightGauge. The new Agent Summary Report in BrightGauge provides a brief overview of all the machines under monitoring, the total number of machines broken down by the number of workstations and the number of servers per site. It gives details of how many of these machines have been offline since more than 60 days (configurable), how many of these machines are out of date (older version of agent). This report provides key information for troubleshooting and performing agent cleanup, updating agent versions, removing duplicate agents, or uninstalling offline agents.

For more information review the Agent Report Article.

Ticketing / PSA Integration

Autotask PSA - Ticket/asset sync detailed error. We are updating the error information received while syncing the tickets or assets information to PSA and this information will be available in the PSA sync report section. We will be adding a corresponding page in documentation which will provide impact and detailed troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue. This will be release on July 29th.

ConnectWise Manage PSA - Ticket/asset sync detailed error. We are updating the error information received while syncing the tickets or assets information to PSA and this information will be available in the PSA sync report section. We will be adding a corresponding page in documentation which will provide impact and detailed troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue. This will be release on July 29th.

Bug Fixes

The following issues will be resolved with this month's release:

Ticketing / PSA Integration: We have resolved an issue with ticket sync to Autotask PSA where the ticket would fail with the following error "failed to acquire lock for ticket id".

Ticketing / PSA Integration: We have resolved an issue where the Backup appliance counts for Recover will not be updated to the corresponding Service/agreement in Autotasl/ConnectWise Manage.

Task Changes and Updates

This month we will begin a staged partner-by-partner migration that will take effect through July 23rd. You will not see any changes until you been migrated. Migrations will occur during off-hours and, on average, take two minutes to complete. You will receive a notification in the Asio Platform (ITSupport Portal) letting you know that your migration has been completed.

Control Installation via Policies (Coming in July)

We will start to rollout control installation options for site via the Policies & Packages starting next month. After this change, the option to opt in for Control at a site will be removed from the RMM Setup, and will be managed by the policies that are assigned to the sites.

For more information, please review the Migration of Control configuration to Policies and Packages FAQs.

Executive Reports for new OS patching

A new Executive Summary report called ITSupport247 Executive Report v2.0 has been rolled out to all Command and Connectwise RMM partners. This Executive report has OS patching scores for Server and Desktops. Two additional Gauges have also been added to the Executive Report for OS patching.

ConnectWise RMM
Communicator

End-users can receive patching reboot notifications without the Communicator being enabled on their endpoint. The Communicator is no longer needed to run in the system tray for an endpoint to receive a reboot notification. The agent components will now run in the background and show any messages to the user. The Communicator will need to be enabled to use the functionalities of the Tool which are available in the System tray. This will be released on June 30th.

Monitoring

New Preview Alert. We will be adding a new SMART disk monitoring alert for Server and Desktop called Preview Alert. You can enable the monitoring condition and receive alerts for any disk issues observed.

Patching

Ability to enable or disable Patch Reboot Notifications with Policy. We are providing new options within OS Patching Policy to turn Reboot Notifications ON or OFF as per your preference. The default option will be ON. This will be released on June 23rd.

UI Improvement. We have improved the UI on the Device Details > OS Patching to show the complete OS Name of the endpoint.

Portal

Agent Update. An agent update, version 2.1.802, will be rolled out in phased manner starting June 30th.

New section for Asio™ Platform (ITSupport Portal) Release Notes. As we work to offer better flexibility for our solutions, we've decided to create a new section for Asio Release notes, separating them from the monthly ConnectWise RMM and Command Releases.

IP Restriction Management is available to all Asio™ Platform (ITSupport Portal) Partners. We have added a new feature called IP Restriction Managment. This feature allows you to define and manage an allowed list of IP addresses that can access the Asio Platform and it's products within such as ConnectWise RMM, Command, and Recover. To learn more, visit the IP Restriction Management for the Asio Platform article.

We have also added an IP Restriction Management FAQ page.

Ticketing / PSA Integration

AutoTask PSA Rebrand. AutoTask PSA integration screens will be rebranded to display ConnectWise RMM instead of being displayed as Continuum Sites. This will be released on June 30th.

New resync button for ConenctWise Manage partners. We will be adding a new button for ConnectWise Manage partners to resync any failed Tickets and any Asset and billing configurations which failed due to an error. You no longer need to run the complete PSA integration wizard to initiate the resync process. This will be released on June 30th.

New resync button for AutoTask partners. We will be adding a new button for AutoTask partners to resync any failed Tickets or any Asset and billing configurations which failed due to an error. You no longer need to run the PSA Test Configuration to initiate the resync process. This will be released on June 30th.

Bug Fixes

The following issues will be resolved with this month's release:

Patching: We resolved an issue where in certain scenario machines would not reboot as per Policy.

Patching: We have resolved a UI bug with Application updates popup in the Devices page would not scale as per the page size.

Patching: We have resolved an issue with Auto-deployment to handle scenarios where the installation was failing when download and install have the same schedule. Also improved the logic to ensure a patch is not downloaded multiple times when the first download is successful.

Ticketing / PSA Integration: We are fixing an issue where some of the configuration items were duplicated when the complete asset data was not received from the endpoint.
