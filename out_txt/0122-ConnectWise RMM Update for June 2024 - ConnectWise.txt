Overview 

This page provides information on the latest enhancements and features for ConnectWise RMM.

Announcements  
Advanced Network Monitoring

We have released an upgraded version of Network Monitoring. Advanced Network Monitoring is an add-on product, enabled at the site level. For an additional cost, you can upgrade your embedded Network Monitoring capabilities including:

Configuration backup comparison and history so you no longer need to guess what changed between configurations. Instantly bring back any previous configuration from the version history when needed (requires SSH). 

60 out-of-the-box SNMP alerts to leverage our best practices recommendations and stay on top of network events (requires SNMP). 

Real-time statistics for better tracking of bandwidth, utilization, and packets. 

NorthStar troubleshooting tool that maps the path of a device to the internet (requires SNMP).

In Console Reports in the Asio Platform

Asio reporting will be improved to ensure consistency in data across the Asio platform and Reporting pages. This enhancement will apply to the following reports this month:

Automation Execution Summary - Gives an overview of automation executed across all endpoints
Automation Execution Detailed - Gives granular level information on endpoint-automation execution 
New Onboarding Page for Webroot

We will introduce a new Webroot signup page for partners purchasing Webroot from ConnectWise. This new signup page will replace the legacy onboarding page.

ScreenConnect Instance access to CW SSO

Your ScreenConnect instance will be moved to CW SSO for Authentication by the end of the month.
