Announcements
API Migration: V1 to V2 Transition

In the past, when partners accessed ConnectWise Asio® data for endpoints, each device used a public identifier as its unique reference. However, these IDs wouldn’t match the data exposed to them via ConnectWise PSA™ (Manage), Asio console, Snowflake Syndication, Reports and Dashboards (formerly BrightGauge™), etc., which would cause confusion. 

Hence, to ensure consistency in the system for device identifiers, we have now made sure that every system or solution connected to Asio will use a common identifier (Private IDs).  

To support this change, we have migrated several APIs from V1 to V2 to align with the new framework and improve consistency across services.  

For partners who have stored or maintained the device's data, we will add an additional API that allows you to retrieve Public-to-Private or vice versa to support this transition. 

Note: Not all API endpoints have changed from V1 to V2, and some can continue to operate or be functional. Older API endpoints that are updated will be deprecated soon.

Key Details

Endpoint IDs shared with partners will now be private (public-to-private mapping is discontinued). 
A conversion API is available under Devices on the developer portal to help update integrations: 
Convert private → public and public → private endpoint IDs. 
Partners must update their systems to use only private endpoint IDs going forward.

Migration Guidance

Stop using public endpoint IDs in all API calls. 
Use the conversion API under Devices on the developer portal to update your systems: 
Convert public → private and private → public IDs as needed during migration. 
Update all integrations to consume only V2 APIs.

Developer Portal Links

The following link provides access to all API Swagger specifications, including both V1 and V2:

Partner APIs: https://developer.connectwise.com/Products/ConnectWise_Asio/Asio_Vendors/APIs_and_Callbacks/REST_API

Timeline

Complete migration by April 30, 2026. 
Start consuming V2 APIs immediately. 
V1 APIs and Legacy Reporting APIs will be deprecated by April 30, 2026.

Devices
Introducing the New Asio Discovery Tool

The Asio Discovery Tool is now fully integrated into ConnectWise Asio, giving you a faster, more seamless way to scan endpoints and deploy agents across your environment.

For more information, please review the Asio Discovery Tool documentation.

What’s New and Improved

No remote access needed. You can run subnet scans directly from Asin without needing to connect to a probe machine and configure the scan.

Multi‑subnet scanning: Easily scan multiple subnets within a single configuration.
Smarter credential handling: Add multiple credential sets with automatic retries to minimize scan failures.
Unified scanning & deployment: Perform both discovery and agent deployment from one streamlined workflow.
Easier access to historical scan data:  Review previous scan data from a single interface to review devices that were discovered

How to Access It

Navigate to Endpoints > Devices (Preview), select any Windows device, and go to:
Actions > Manage > Asio Discovery Tool

Flexible Scan Scheduling

Create and modify automated scan schedules with options to:

Scan only
Scan and deploy

Granular Controls

Asio Discovery Tool supports granular permissions to allow users to view scan results and perform ad hoc agent deployment via the UI.

Enhanced Visibility

Get a high‑level view of discovered devices and installed agents through intuitive dashboard widgets.
