Overview 

This article is intended to help ConnectWise Asio® and RMM Primary Admins create companies and sites in Clients > Companies.

Important: We recommend deploying agents to your internal organization first and following the steps below to create a Company and Site for your internal testing.

Requirements
Access to the Asio platform with ConnectWise SSO.
Client Management permissions. By default the Primary and Super Admin, Technician, and Manager roles retain all Client Management permissions.
Resource assignments or site access. Resource assignments automatically grant the user permission to view. For more information, refer to Resource Assignment for the Asio platform.
Client Management Permissions

Application roles are assigned in ConnectWise Home and can be customized for granular access to client management permissions. Refer to Application Roles for more information about assigning and customizing application roles.

Video: How to Create a Company and a Site

Note: When a user creates a company and site, it is auto-assigned to the user who created it.

Sign in to the Asio platform.
Navigate to Clients > Companies.
Click Add Company.


When you open a form to add a company, site, or contact, you can select from Central Peek, Side Peek, Bottom Peek, or Full Page to change the location of the form on your screen. Click the Peek option at the top of the form to select your preference from the drop-down.


Enter the Company Name and Primary Site details to create a primary site.


Note: Create a unique company ID, site name, and primary site ID. The primary site name you create is the primary office location. 

Enter the Primary Site Details to create a primary site with the address and contact information for the company.

Click Save.

Your new company now appears in the list under Company List with the primary site in the Site List.

Create a Site

After you've created your primary company and primary site, you can add additional sites on the Company Details > Site List.

Add Site
Click a parent company to navigate to the Company Details page.
Click the Add Site button located in the header of the Site List.

Enter the site details in the required fields.

Click Save.

Your new site is then listed on the Company Details page.
Edit a Site

To edit the name or contact details of the site:

Navigate to the Company Details page and select the checkbox of the site you want to edit.
Click Actions > Edit Site.
Edit the details of the site.
Click Save.
Delete a Site

Note: You cannot delete a primary site.

Navigate to the Company Details page and select the checkbox of the site you want to delete.
Click Actions > Delete Site.

Click Confirm to delete. When a site is deleted, the respective managed endpoints associated with the site will also be uninstalled. If a user or technician wants to remove selective endpoints, they can use the Agent Management section to remove the Agents.
Enable your Sites for RMM

After you have created your company and site, you can now enable the site with RMM. Site Configuration Settings are site-level settings that can be enabled via policies. Follow the steps below to set up the policy and assign it to your site, for more details refer to RMM Site Configuration Policy and proceed to Install Agents.

This policy is required to enable the RMM Services on a particular site. To create an RMM Site Configuration policy, 

Navigate to Endpoints > Policies & Packages > Policies.
Click Add Policy.
When the new policy page loads, In the Left section of the page, you should see the below fields.
Change the Category field from Devices to Sites. 


In the Type dropdown, select RMM Site Configuration and give your policy a Name of your choice.


Under the settings for your RMM Site Configuration policy, enable and disable the configurations and settings you require.

To enable RMM for a site via this policy, update the Enable RMM Services toggle to the Enabled state. 

On enabling RMM for a site, you will get the option to enable NOC Services for RMM. You can choose to enable the NOC Services or keep it disabled.

Note: RMM NOC Services are paid add-ons. If you enable these services, they will be charged to you in your monthly invoice. For details on NOC Services, please review the NOC Services documentation.

Another key field for enabling RMM on a site is the Notification Rule. This rule defines how ConnectWise RMM and NOC will communicate with the partner.
Click Save.
Package to Site Assignment 
Assign a package to Site(s): Each Policy included in a Site Assigned Package will be automatically inherited by all Devices under the Site, including ones added in the future.
Navigate to Endpoints > Policies & Packages > Assignment > Sites tab
Check the box for each selected Site
Click Assign Package
Click the Name of the Package
Click Assign
Remove a package from a Site(s): Removing a package from a Site will revert all Devices under the Site that are not assigned an Override to their inherited values.
Navigate to Endpoints > Packages > Sites tab
Check the box for each selected Site
Click Remove Assignment
Click OK

Important: A site can only be assigned one (1) package. Assigning a second package to a site will replace the site's current package.
