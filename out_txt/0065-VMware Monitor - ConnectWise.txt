Overview

VMware Monitors allow you to define a VMware Host and VMware Guest data to monitor a target endpoint.

How to create a VMware Host Availability Monitor

Navigate to Endpoints > Devices > Alerts > Monitors.

Click Add Monitor.

Provide a Name for the new monitor. Optionally you can provide a Description of your new monitor.

Select the Type as VMware from the drop-down to create the appropriate monitor.

Select the Family and Severity from the drop-down menus.

To enable the Mapper functionality, you need to turn on the toggle. To learn more about the Mapper functionality review this documentation.

Under the Condition section:
Machine Type: This allows you to select the Machine Type as Host or VM. For host-based monitoring, select the value from the dropdown as Host.
Type: Select the type of monitoring to be defined against the host device.
Status: Select the status for which the monitor should trigger the alert.
Running This allows you to define the host status as Running.
Not Running This allows you to define the host status as Not Running.
You can also select a custom Automation Task to be executed when the condition is met on the endpoint.

Note: System will reflect only selective Automation tasks that do not need parameters. Refer these OOTB tasks which needs parameters. All Custom Scripts created will be available for selection.

Under the Ticket Resolution section you can define if the ticket should be updated as Resolved once the following criteria is met:

Machine Type: This allows you to select the Machine Type as Host or VM. For host-based monitoring, select the value from the dropdown as Host.
Type: Select the type of monitoring to be defined against the host device.
Status: Select the status for which the monitor should trigger the alert.
Running This allows you to define the host status as Running.
Not Running This allows you to define the host status as Not Running.

Under the Resources section, you can select the target endpoints on which the alerts should be triggered. You can select specific machines, Sites, or a Dynamic or a Static group.

Click Save to create and apply the monitor to the targets.

 

How to create a VMware Guest / VM Monitor

Navigate to Endpoints > Devices > Alerts > Monitors.

Click Add Monitor.

Provide a Name for the new monitor. Optionally you can provide a Description of your new monitor.

Select the Type as VMware from the drop-down for creating the appropriate monitor.

Select the Family and Severity from the drop-down menus.

To enable the Mapper functionality, you need to turn on the toggle. To learn more about the Mapper functionality review this documentation.

Under the Condition section:
Machine Type: This allows you to select the Machine Type as Host or VM. For guest-based monitoring, select the value from the dropdown as VM.
Monitoring Type: Select the type of monitoring to be defined.
State Monitoring: This allows you to define the state monitoring of the VM.
Condition: This allows you to define the state of the VM.
Running: This allows you to define the condition for the VM as Running for triggering an alert.
Not Running: This allows you to define the condition for the VM as Not Running for triggering an alert.
Number of Snapshots: This allows you to define the snapshot for VM.
 Condition: This allows you to define the condition of the snapshot for VM.
Above: This allows you to define the condition for the snapshot to be above a specific value.
Below:  This allows you to define the condition for the snapshot to be below a specific value.
Equals to: This allows you to define the condition for the checkpoints to be equal to a specific value.
Size of Snapshot: This allows you to define the snapshot size for VMs (This will be the size of each separate snapshot.)
Condition: This allows you to define the condition of the snapshot size of the VM.
Above: This allows you to define the condition for the size of the snapshot to be Above a specific value.
Below:  This allows you to define the condition for the size of the snapshot to be below a specific value.
Value This allows you to define the value that should be used for triggering the alert.
Unit This allows you to define the values for the Unit to be used for comparing.
MB: This allows you to set the values in MB.
GB: This allows you to set the values in GB.
You can also select a custom Automation Task to be executed when the condition was met on the endpoint

Note: System will reflect only selective Automation tasks that do not need parameters. Refer these OOTB tasks which needs parameters. All Custom Scripts created will be available for selection.

Under the Ticket Resolution section you can define if the ticket should be updated as Resolved once the following criteria is met:

Machine Type: This allows you to select the Machine Type as Host or VM. For guest-based monitoring, select the value from the dropdown as VM.
Monitoring Type: Select the type of monitoring to be defined.
State Monitoring: This allows you to define the state monitoring of the VM.
Condition: This allows you to define the state of the VM.
Running: This allows you to define the condition for the VM as Running for triggering an alert.
Not Running: This allows you to define the condition for the VM as Not Running for triggering an alert.
Number of Snapshots: This allows you to define the snapshot for VM.
 Condition: This allows you to define the condition of the snapshot for VM.
Above: This allows you to define the condition for the snapshot to be above a specific value.
Below:  This allows you to define the condition for the snapshot to be below a specific value.
Equals to: This allows you to define the condition for the checkpoints to be equal to a specific value.
Size of Snapshot: This allows you to define the Snapshot size for VM's (This will be the sum of all snapshots.)
Condition: This allows you to define the condition of the snapshot size of VM.
Above: This allows you to define the condition for the size of the snapshot to be Above a specific value.
Below:  This allows you to define the condition for the size of the snapshot to be below a specific value.
Value This allows you to define the value that should be used for triggering the alert.
Unit This allows you to define the values for the Unit to be used for comparing.
MB: This allows you to set the values in MB.
GB: This allows you to set the values in GB.

Under the Resources section, you can select the target endpoints on which the alerts should be triggered. You can select specific machines, Sites, or a Dynamic or a Static group.

Click Save to create and apply the monitor to the targets.

Note:

For Virtual machine monitoring, the alert will be generated for machines where the agent is installed.

For Virtual machine checkpoint-size monitoring, the alert will be generated for each snapshot separately.

For the monitor to work correctly, a metric in the condition section needs to be the same as in the resolution section, otherwise alert will not be generated.

Note: Monitors are triggered based on the defined configuration.
