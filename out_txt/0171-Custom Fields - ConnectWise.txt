Overview

Custom Fields are additional data points you can create in the ConnectWise Asio® platform to record information that the agent does not collect or that is unavailable out of the box. Further, you can use custom fields to tag or create fields with values for endpoints, companies, sites, tickets, and ticket notes using relevant data for internal business processes. Custom Fields, as the name suggests, are fully customizable and appear on the Devices page according to the configured settings. You completely manage custom fields, and the Asio agent cannot modify them.

Important: Please note that Custom Fields should not be utilized to collect or retrieve personally identifiable information.

To locate this screen in the Asio platform, navigate to Settings > Custom Fields. 

Definition and Administration of Custom Fields

Note: Settings > Custom Fields permissions are available for Primary Super Admins, Super Admins, and Managers by default. You can add permission for custom fields to any non-admin application role. For more details, refer to Application Roles for the Asio Platform.

The Add new custom field window opens. You can adjust the window placement using the Peek option.

Enter the Name of the field. A maximum of 32 characters (letters, numbers, and underscores are allowed).
Select the Level. Custom fields can be applied at the following levels:

Select the Type of the field.

Select from the following values:
Datepicker – For fields with date and time stamp values.
Dropdown – For fields where values are limited to available options. Options are customizable.
Flag – For fields with Boolean values (Yes or No).
Text Box – For fields with text values (Maximum of 300 characters).
Select or enter a Default value for the field. If a default value is entered for a field, all the applicable fields have that value as the default. Users can then modify/update the values per endpoint from the Devices UI. The Default value options depend on the Type selection.
Each field can be marked as either Editable or not. If a field is marked as Editable, users can modify its values through the Devices UI (explained later in this document).
Click Save to create the field.

After custom fields are created in Settings > Custom Fields, they are visible on the Device Details page. Select a specific device or workstation from Endpoints > Devices to open Device Details.
Click the Custom Fields tab to view values for all created custom fields and also edit field values.


Click on the Edit icon to modify fields. You can edit values for fields if they are defined as Is Editable when creating the custom field.


Different types of fields have different input options. To update the value for the field, select or enter the new value.
Click Update to confirm. Select the desired value and click Save. The value for that field is then updated for that respective endpoint.
Data for the user who modified the value and when it was modified is also shown in the table.
