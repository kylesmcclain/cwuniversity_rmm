Overview

Every macOS device must have the agent installed for it to report back to the Asio™ platform (ITSupport Portal) with monitoring information. The macOS Agents can be downloaded from the Asio platform and installed on your device.

Once your company and site have been set up, please check the agent prerequisites and compatibility information available in Prerequisites.

Download and Install macOS Agent

Please refer to Download and Install macOS Agent for detailed setup information.

Supported Mac 64-bit* OS X versions 

The macOS agent version 3.1.1 and above is a native agent, supported on both Apple silicon and Intel-based macOS devices.

Hardware Requirement 
CPU: Pentium 4 or Apple silicon or comparable processor.
RAM: 2 GB and above.
Disk Storage: 1.5 GB on the drive where the agent will be installed.

Disk storage for auto-updating agents: An additional 2 GB of storage should always be available on the machine for the agent to get auto-updated.

Note: Not meeting the above requirements may result in failure of agent installation/auto-update.

RMM Scanning Tool

The RMM Scanning Tool allows you to:

Perform on-demand RMM desktop and server (where applicable) agent deployments to Windows, Mac, and Linux machines under your management.
Set up a schedule to scan and deploy agents to newly discovered systems on a network.
Update resources with agents installed to the latest agent version.

Refer to Deploying Agents to Mac and Linux Resources using the RMM Scanning Tool for more information.

Mac Patch Management 

Mac Patch Assessment occurs every Wednesday and Friday at 10:30 am (local time) to collect details of missing and installed patches. Mac Desktop Patch Deployment occurs on the day(s) and timeframe designated by a respective machine's assigned patch policy. Review the Policies and Packages documentation for more information.

ScreenConnect

To enable control for your macOS endpoints, review the ScreenConnect Integration with ConnectWise RMM Documentation.

Note: Refer to the ConnectWise remote access guide for manual assignment of permissions on a macOS endpoint.

Mac Scripts

macOS-compatible tasks are listed in detail in Available Tasks. Review the Tasks documentation for adding macOS details to scripts.
