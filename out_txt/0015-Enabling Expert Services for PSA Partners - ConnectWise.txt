Overview

This document provides an overview of how to enable ConnectWise PSA™, ConnectWise RMM™, ConnectWise NOC Services™, and ConnectWise Help Desk Services™ through five phases of enablement.

These phases include the following:

Initial PSA Setup and Mapping
RMM Integration & Sync
NOC Services Enablement
Help Desk Enablement
Execute Services per Site
Phase 1: Initial PSA Configuration and RMM–PSA Data Mapping

Establish a secure integration between ConnectWise PSA and the RMM platform, and ensure foundational data (companies, sites, assets) are mapped. This phase lays the groundwork so that subsequent phases operate on aligned data and proper credentials.

Steps:

Map Companies, Sites, and Assets between RMM and PSA. Begin by mapping your customer accounts (companies) and sites in the RMM to those in PSA. This foundational step ensures that tickets and automated workflows in RMM will correspond to the correct company records in PSA. For example, if ABC Corp is a company in PSA with two sites, make sure ABC Corp and its sites exist in the RMM and are linked. This alignment provides a single source of truth for assets and tickets across systems
Create a Dedicated API Member in PSA for Integration. In PSA, navigate to System > Members > API Members and add a new API member (integration account).
Assign appropriate security roles to this member. This is a role that has access to tickets, configurations, and companies required for integration. Setting up a separate integration user follows security best practices, isolating integration privileges. Mark the member Active and save. This account will be used by RMM to communicate with the PSA.
Generate API Keys for the API Member. Still in PSA, go to the newly created API member’s API Keys tab and generate a new API key pair (public and private key). Copy these keys one time and store them securely – you will need to enter them into RMM to authenticate the integration.

Note: The private key is not shown again after you close the window, so ensure it’s saved in a secure location.

Configure PSA Ticketing Settings (Service Boards, Statuses, and Categories). In PSA, set up the structures that are used to organize tickets coming from RMM.
Service Board: Create or identify a service board, for example, Remote Support, that house tickets generated by RMM. Within that board, configure statuses (e.g., New, In Progress, Resolved) that align with your support workflow.
Categories/Subcategories: Define relevant ticket categories (and subcategories if needed) on that board, such as Hardware, Software, etc., to classify tickets.
Priorities and SLA: Ensure ticket priority levels are set and correspond to your response SLAs.
Products/Config Types & Units of Measure: If the integration creates configuration items or utilizes products, verify that product types and configuration types exist for assets, and units of measure are set, so any assets or time entries sync correctly.

Note: These configurations define how inbound tickets from RMM are categorized and who they get assigned to. For instance, by creating a dedicated Remote Support board with specific teams and categories, you ensure alerts from RMM land in the right place. For example, a Server Offline alert might come in as a ticket on the Remote Support board under category Network. This organization is critical for efficient triage.

Enable PSA Integration Policies in RMM

In the Asio, navigate to Policies and locate or create the PSA Integration policy settings. Input the ConnectWise PSA URL and the API keys obtained earlier to connect RMM to PSA. Enable policies that automate ticket handling, for example:

Ticket Sync: Turn on the setting to create tickets in PSA from RMM alerts (often labeled Create ticket on alert or similar). Configure which alerts should generate tickets (you might start with critical alerts only).
Priority Mapping: Map the alert priority/severity levels in RMM to ticket priorities in PSA. For example, a Critical RMM alert could map to a High priority PSA ticket. This ensures urgency is conveyed correctly.
Contact Synchronization: Enable Contact Sync so that contacts (end-user information) associated with tickets are shared between PSA and RMM. This allows a ticket created from an RMM alert to automatically link to the correct customer contact in PSA (if that contact exists).
PSA to RMM Sync: Decide if two-way ticket sync is needed. Normally, enabling PSA to RMM sync updates means changes in PSA tickets (status or notes) reflect back in Asio. If you are not using NOC services, it’s recommended to turn this On to keep both systems in sync. If NOC services are enabled, set this to Off. NOC handles ticket updates in PSA, and automatic back-synchronization could interfere. In the NOC scenario, you handle priority mapping manually (ensure that NOC agents manage PSA ticket statuses in line with RMM priorities)

These policy settings in Asio bridge the two systems. Once configured, your RMM will automatically push alert data to PSA as tickets, and (if enabled) receive updates back. Following the integration checklist (see Appendix) at this stage can be useful to verify each item is configured

Validate Ticket Creation and Routing (Initial Test). With the above in place, perform a quick end-to-end test to ensure Phase 1 setup is successful. For example, trigger a test alert from RMM. You might create a dummy alert or use a real but controlled event, such as a test device going offline. Then, check PSA. A ticket should be generated on the correct service board, with the appropriate status, priority, company, configuration (asset), and contact details attached. Verify the following:
The ticket appears in PSA with the expected information: title, device or alert reference, and timestamps.
The routing is correct. For example, it’s on the Remote Support board and perhaps auto-assigned or in the correct queue.
The contact and configuration item on the ticket match the company/site from which the alert originated.

If the ticket did not appear or has incorrect data, troubleshoot now (check the API keys, board names, mappings, etc.) before moving forward. This validation step is critical to catch any misconfiguration early.

End of Phase 1

By the end of Phase 1, you should have the following:

A PSA instance ready to accept tickets from the RMM.
A secure API integration between Asio and PSA.
A baseline synchronization of companies and assets.

Essentially, the PSA is “aware” of the RMM environment and vice versa. All subsequent service enablement will rely on this foundation being solid.

Phase 2: RMM Integration and Sync Verification

Complete the integration by ensuring RMM alerts and assets are syncing to PSA, and that the workflow from alert generation to ticket resolution is functioning. This phase is about tightening the integration and making sure nothing was missed in setup by cross-checking with best practice checklists and running additional tests.

Steps:

Review the Integration Checklist & Configuration Settings. It’s advisable at this point to cross-reference a PSA–RMM integration checklist (see Appendix for a comprehensive list) to confirm all necessary configuration has been done. Ensure, for example, that: the API member is active, the keys are entered in Asio correctly, the service board and statuses exist in PSA, and the policy in Asio is enabled. Double-check any settings that are easy to overlook (such as time zone configurations, ticket prefix or naming conventions, etc.). Taking time to audit the setup against a checklist helps catch omissions (a practice that prevents many common integration issues).
Validate Asset Synchronization. Check that asset information flows from RMM to PSA. In practice, this means verifying that devices managed in Asio (workstations, servers, network devices) are appearing as Configurations or Assets under the correct Company records in ConnectWise PSA. For example, if you added a new test machine to the RMM, after a synchronization run, that machine should be listed in PSA under the corresponding company’s configurations. Ensure attributes like the device name, serial number, etc., are accurately reflected. Troubleshooting tip: If assets are not syncing, ensure that in Asio’s PSA integration settings the asset sync option is enabled (e.g., Enable Device Sync) and that the RMM agent is deployed on those devices.
Test Alert-to-Ticket Workflow (Advanced). Now test a real-case scenario: trigger an alert in the RMM that should create a ticket based on your policies. For instance, simulate a high priority alert (such as a server service failure or an exceeded resource threshold). Confirm that this results in a ticket in PSA:
The ticket priority in PSA should match the severity of the alert (per the mapping configured)
The ticket’s description or notes should contain details from the alert (for example, error messages or alert type).
If the policy was configured with any custom ticket source or type for RMM-generated tickets, verify those fields are set (this helps identify tickets created by the integration).

Additionally, check the RMM side: the Asio interface might show the alert and indicate that a PSA ticket was created (some systems provide a link or ID reference). This round-trip verification ensures the integration truly connects the two platforms. A successful test here means your PSA and RMM are now in sync for both configuration items and ticket workflow.

Verify Two-Way Updates (if enabled). If in Phase 1 you enabled PSA-to-RMM ticket sync (bi-directional updates), perform a quick check of that mechanism. For example, update the test ticket’s status or add a note in PSA, and see if that update is reflected on the RMM side (Asio ticket view or alert notes) after a short sync interval. Conversely, try closing the alert or resolving it in RMM and confirm that the PSA ticket gets updated (e.g., set to Completed or with a closing note). Bi-directional syncing can be crucial for keeping NOC or support teams on both systems coordinated, so ensure it works if you intend to use it.
Adjust and Document. If any part of the above steps fails or shows discrepancies, adjust the configuration now. This might involve mapping an additional status, correcting a board name, or enabling an option that was off. Document any changes or unique configurations for future reference. It’s easier to fix integration gaps in this dedicated phase than when you’ve moved on to activating live services.
End of Phase 2

By the end of Phase 2, you should have the following:

Confidence that the core integration between the RMM and PSA is functioning as intended.
Companies and devices are syncing, and alerts are creating tickets with correct information.

Essentially, the “plumbing” connecting the systems is confirmed. Now you are ready to layer on the outsourced services (NOC and Help Desk), knowing they will have the data they need.

Phase 3: NOC Services Enablement

Prepare for Network Operations Center (NOC) services by configuring system access for NOC personnel and ensuring processes like escalation are in place. If you have subscribed to ConnectWise’s NOC (where a remote team will monitor and resolve alerts on your behalf), this phase ensures that the team can effectively do their job in your system.

Steps:

Enable NOC User Access (Asio). NOC technicians from ConnectWise need access; under RMM Settings - Site - Provide NOC Access level 1, 2 or 3. Leave at 0 if you want NOC notifications only.

After provisioning, test access by opening a ticket for the NOC.

Security tip: Only grant NOC to Servers that are required (principle of least privilege), e.g., the specific sites.

Confirm Ticket Queue Visibility and Permissions. Once NOC access is active, confirm that ticket queues or views are correctly showing the tickets the NOC should work on. For instance, if there is a dedicated NOC service board or queue in PSA, log in as a NOC user (or impersonate one) to ensure tickets created by the RMM integration appear there. NOC engineers should be able to:

Open tickets, read all details (including any extended fields like related configuration item or PSA ticket IDs in Asio).
Add notes or updates to tickets (e.g., when they start work or need to escalate).
Change status (e.g., from New to In Progress to Resolved).
Create new tickets if necessary (for issues detected manually) – though typically NOC deals with system-generated tickets.
Check that any ticket created by NOC or updated by NOC also syncs back to Asio so that you have visibility from the RMM side as well.
Ensure Escalation Matrix and Site Documentation is in Place. NOC teams often rely on predefined instructions for handling certain situations or needing help. Verify that for each client/site under NOC monitoring, you have provided:
An Escalation Matrix: a list of contacts (with phone/email) to escalate issues that the NOC cannot resolve. This might include on-call technicians, managers, or client contacts for after-hours emergencies. Make sure this list is accessible – for example, as a document attached to the company in PSA, or a knowledge base article the NOC can access.
Site Access Plan: documentation of how the NOC can access the client’s environment if needed. This could be VPN credentials, RDP information, or credentials to specific systems. Often, secure credential storage (like IT Glue or Password Manager) is used and NOC is given access. Ensure instructions to retrieve and use those credentials are clear.
Runbooks/ SOPs: any specific procedures for common alerts (e.g., if a backup fails, do X, Y, Z) that the NOC should follow. Provide links or documents for these processes.
Make sure these resources are up-to-date and shared through the agreed channel. Visibility check: Open a sample ticket as a NOC user and see if the ticket has links or references to the site’s escalation info (some partners include the escalation matrix ID in each ticket or link to a SharePoint/OneNote page). If not, ensure NOC knows where to find this information externally.
Test NOC Workflow (Optional but Recommended). Coordinate with the NOC team to do a dry-run. For example, have the NOC pick up a test alert-generated ticket and go through the motions of working it: acknowledging it in Asio, adding a note in PSA, perhaps resolving it or escalating. This exercise will confirm that:
Notifications (if any, like email or Teams alerts on ticket updates) are working and reaching the right people.
The NOC can successfully escalate an issue to your on-call (if they try an escalation, you or your team get the message).
The status changes flow properly (when NOC sets the ticket to Escalated or Resolved, it syncs and triggers any automation if configured).
It’s easier to iron out role or permission issues now than when a critical incident is happening.
End of Phase 3

By the end of Phase 3, you should have the following:

The NOC service is effectively integrated.
Your remote NOC team has access to the systems, can see and manage the tickets, and has all the necessary information to support your clients.

In other words, the “eyes and hands” that monitor your network 24/7 are all set up in your tools, with clarity on how to escalate issues back to you or the client.

Phase 4: Help Desk Services Enablement

If you are utilizing the Help Desk, the outsourced help desk service for end-user calls and tickets, configure the system for Help Desk agents and verify that they can create and manage tickets on behalf of your clients. This phase ensures your front-line support is ready to go, integrated with the PSA and RMM. 

Steps:

Provision Help Desk User Accounts and Roles. Just like with NOC, Help Desk agents need accounts in the relevant systems: likely the phone system (e.g., Five9, if used for calls) and the ticketing system (CW Home/PSA and Asio). Make sure each Help Desk agent has:
A user account in PSA with permissions to create and edit tickets on the service boards they’ll handle. They might use a specialized role such as “Help Desk Technician.”
A user account in Asio (if they will use the RMM interface for ticket lookup or creation) with a Ticketing role assigned. The RMM’s user management should map these accounts so they can search contacts and log tickets.
Access to any telephony or chat system that’s integrated (if the Help Desk is answering calls, ensure they know how to create a ticket from a call).

After setup, test login for a sample Help Desk user. They should be able to reach PSA and see at least the boards/queues for their tickets, possibly limited to a Help Desk board or the general service boards, depending on how you structure it.

Enable Contact and Ticket Search Features. An efficient Help Desk relies on quickly finding customer information. In Asio, ensure that Contact Search is enabled by name, email, or phone number. This allows an agent to verify caller identity and link tickets to the right contact on the fly. In PSA, this might already be standard, but it’s worth confirming that the Help Desk agents know how to use the search (for example, using the global search bar or a quick find tool). Also, ensure that if the Help Desk needs to look up device details, they can search configurations or assets by name or serial number. All relevant data (contacts, companies, configurations) should be accessible through search to the Help Desk role.
Conduct a quick test: as a Help Desk user, try searching for a known contact’s name and verify the system returns the record.
Validate Ticket Creation and Updates by Help Desk. Have the Help Desk team perform end-to-end ticket actions to confirm everything works:
Ticket Creation: Simulate an end-user call scenario. The Help Desk agent creates a new ticket in PSA for a test issue (e.g., “Printer not working at XYZ Corp”). The agent fills in the required fields: contact, configuration (if applicable), summary, and initial notes. Upon saving, the ticket appears on the appropriate service board in PSA.
Ticket Editing: have the agent update the ticket and add a note or update the status to In Progress. Ensure they can do so without permission issues.
Linking to Contact/Asset: Verify that the ticket is correctly linked to the customer’s contact and (if relevant) the affected asset. For instance, if the issue was with a specific workstation, the ticket’s Config Item field should contain that workstation. The agent should be able to set or change that field via search.
Resolution and Sync: Finally, let the agent resolve/close the ticket. The closure should be synced back to Asio and the RMM should mark the alert or ticket as Resolved as well (assuming two-way sync is on). Conversely, if the RMM had an open alert for this issue, resolving the ticket might auto-close it, or the agent might have to clear the alert – confirm the process.

Throughout this test, check that notifications or workflows (if any, like notifying the end-user or sending a closure email) are functioning as expected. A key outcome is that the Help Desk agent can seamlessly handle tickets without needing excessive permissions or help from admins.

 End of Phase 4

By the end of Phase 4, you should have the following:

Your Help Desk service ready to go live.
Agents are set up in the system and can find partner info, log tickets, with those tickets flowing into your PSA just as if your own team entered them.

Your end users can call the help desk and everything will be handled and recorded in your PSA/RMM as per normal operations.

Operational Readiness and Final Validation

With all four phases of configuration complete, it is crucial to do a final pass ensuring the operational readiness of the entire setup. This is essentially a pre-go-live checklist to confirm that every component (PSA, RMM, NOC, Help Desk) is connected and configured properly.

User Access Confirmation: Verify all necessary accounts have access to the systems. This includes your internal administrators, any partner engineers, NOC agents, and Help Desk agents. Everyone should be able to log in to PSA and Asio with the roles assigned to them, and see what they need to see. Make sure no account is stuck with pending invites or wrong email addresses, etc.
Entitlement and Licensing Mapping: Ensure that the ConnectWise entitlements (licenses/permissions for services) are correctly mapped to your account and client sites. For example, if you’ve purchased NOC for 50 endpoints, ensure those endpoints/sites are marked for NOC service in the configuration. If a client does not receive NOC or Help Desk, ensure they are not inadvertently included. This mapping might have been done during setup via policies; double-check it now.
Ticket Routing Logic: Walk through the ticket flow one more time for different scenarios. For instance, check if an RMM alert to a PSA ticket went to the right board, a NOC update notification, or a Help Desk call turn into a ticket creation went to the correct queue. Validate automation rules like ticket assignments, prioritization, and any service level agreements (SLAs) you have in place. If you have escalation or notification rules (like the NOC Notification Rule created earlier), confirm they fire as expected when a ticket hits certain statuses.
Extended Attribute Visibility: Check that extended attributes and references are visible to those who need them. For example, ensure the PSA ticket ID is showing in the RMM interface for a given alert/ticket and vice versa possibly the RMM alert ID or device name is recorded in the PSA ticket (perhaps in a custom field or the description). This cross-reference is important for tracking issues across systems. Also, verify that time entries or notes added via one system are visible in the other, where applicable.
Backup and Fallback Plans: Although not explicitly part of configuration, as an operational best practice, have a fallback plan. If the integration faces issues, know how to disable the sync to handle tickets manually in the interim. Ensure you have documentation on the configuration (like the API keys, board names, etc.) stored securely, so you can recover or recreate integration quickly if needed.
Stakeholder Review: It might be useful at this stage to do a quick review with key stakeholders (e.g., service manager or a senior engineer) to demonstrate the end-to-end flow. This can highlight any last tweaks needed from an operational standpoint.

Once the above checks are satisfactory, you’re ready to deploy the services fully to production. 

Deploying the Help Desk Service to Client Sites

With everything configured and validated, the final steps involve activating the actual service to the client sites so that the Help Desk can go live. ConnectWise uses RMM Packages to bundle to assure ticket and contacts are synced and apply policies to one or multiple sites.

Help Desk Deployment

To enable the Help Desk service for your clients, you will create or use a policy that configures the PSA integration for Help Desk tickets and then deploy it to the target sites.

Create a Help Desk Site Policy in Asio: In Asio , navigate to Endpoints > Policies and select Add Policy. Choose Site Policy and then select the template or category for ConnectWise PSA Integration. This ensures the policy has the PSA-related settings. Give the new policy a clear name, for example, “Help Desk Ticket Sync – PSA Integration”. Using a descriptive name helps everyone recognize what the policy is for.
Configure Ticket Synchronization Settings: Within this policy, you’ll see various options to configure the integration behavior for that site (or multiple sites). Key settings to set:
Ticket Sync: Turn this On This activates the creation of tickets in PSA for any Help Desk-related issues from the RMM side. Help Desk issues may originate from RMM alerts if an alert triggers a user-facing issue, but often Help Desk tickets are entered by agents; however, this setting is generally needed to allow two-way updates as well.
Service Board Mapping: Select the appropriate Service Board in PSA where Help Desk tickets should reside. This might be the same board used earlier or a dedicated Help Desk board if you use one. Align this with how your operation is structured. Also choose what ticket notes or details to sync. For instance, you might sync all public notes, but not internal notes, depending on what you want the RMM to see.
Ticket Type/Source: If the policy screen allows, specify the default ticket type and source for tickets created under this policy. This helps categorize tickets coming from the Help Desk vs those from NOC or automated alerts.
Map Ticket Priority Sync (RMM to PSA): Scroll to the section for Priority Mapping. Here, define how RMM priorities translate to PSA ticket statuses or priorities on the Help Desk board For example, you might map critical alerts to Emergency tickets, Warning to Medium priority tickets, etc., by selecting the corresponding statuses. Ensure the mapping aligns with your PSA's configured statuses (which we set up in Phase 1). This ensures if a Help Desk agent flags something as high priority in one system, it is reflected properly in the other.
Communicator Ticket Handling: If applicable, the policy may have an option regarding Communicator tickets (these refer to chat or internal communication tickets). Often, best practice is to leave Communicator ticket sync off (not sync these to PSA), because they are not actual client-facing tickets and can clutter the boards. In the interface, you might see an option like Sync Communicator Tickets – choose Off if that is recommended for your workflow.
PSA to RMM Sync for Help Desk: Decide if you want changes made in PSA by Help Desk agents to reflect back in RMM. Typically, if NOC is not involved on these tickets, you can enable PSA-to-RMM sync so that any updates or closures by the Help Desk in PSA update the RMM view. This was set to On in general earlier, but here you can control it per policy. If NOC is also involved for the same site, keep this Off to avoid confusion (NOC and Help Desk shouldn't both sync the same tickets; in such case, NOC might handle closures).
Contact Sync: Ensure Contact Sync is On. This allows any new contacts created by Help Desk (if an end-user isn’t in the PSA yet and they add one) to sync to the RMM, and generally keeps contact info unified. It was likely enabled globally, but double-check at policy level if present.
Save and Deploy the Policy via a Package: Once the policy settings are configured for Help Desk, save the policy. Next, create a Package that includes this policy (if not automatically packaged). A package in Asio is used to deploy one or more policies to one or many sites. Add the new Help Desk policy to a package (you might name the package “Enable Help Desk Service”) and select the client sites that should receive the Help Desk service. Deploy the package to those sites. The system will apply the policy, and thus turn on the integration features for those endpoints.
Activation of Help Desk Service: With the policy deployed, follow any final activation steps outlined by ConnectWise. For instance, ConnectWise documentation (see Activating Help Desk) may instruct to notify the ConnectWise team that the site is ready, or simply that from this point, Help Desk tickets will begin flowing. Make sure the ConnectWise Help Desk coordinators know which sites are now onboarded for services (they usually have this info, but communication is key).
Post-Deployment Verification: As a final check, generate or pick up a real issue on one of the newly deployed sites. The Help Desk handles it and a ticket appears in your PSA. Verify the policy settings took effect. For example, confirm the ticket landed on the correct board and the notes are syncing. This verifies that the deployment package worked.

By deploying the Help Desk package, you have essentially “switched on” the Help Desk service for the chosen clients, operationalizing all the configuration done in earlier phases.

Deploying the NOC Service to Client Sites

Enabling the NOC service involves a similar process of applying a policy (often at the site level) that signals those sites are under NOC monitoring, along with any necessary rule configuration.

Prepare a NOC Notification Rule: Before creating the NOC deployment policy, ensure you have set up a Notification Rule for NOC in Asio. In the Asio platform, under Notifications or NOC settings, create a rule that defines which alerts or events should trigger notifications to the NOC. For example, “Critical server down alerts to NOC team with 24×7 coverage.” The ConnectWise documentation on setting Notification Rules (see link in Appendix) provides guidance. Having this rule in place is required because the NOC policy will ask to link a notification rule.
Create a “NOC Enablement” Site Policy: Go to Endpoints > Policies and add a new policy. Select Site Policy and choose RMM Site Configuration as the type (this category includes NOC related options). Name the policy something like Enable NOC Services for clarity.
Configure NOC Settings in the Policy: In the policy settings:
Enable RMM Product If applicable, ensure the base RMM is marked as enabled. It usually is by default if the site is in your RMM, but some policies explicitly toggle product availability.
Enable NOC Services: Check this option On. This flags to the system that this site will use NOC.
Notification Rule: Select the NOC Notification Rule you prepared from the dropdown. This ties the rule to the site – meaning whenever the conditions of that rule are met, it will notify/assign to NOC.
If additional fields are present, like coverage hours or NOC plan level, set them according to your service agreement. Typically, NOC is 24×7 on critical items by default.
Save and Deploy the NOC Policy Package: Save the NOC site policy. Then create a Package containing this policy (e.g., call it “Enable NOC Service”) and deploy it to all client sites that should have NOC coverage. Deploying will update those sites’ configurations in Asio to activate NOC monitoring and routing.
Provide Credentials and Access Information: After deployment, make sure any credentials or special access the NOC needs (identified in Phase 3) have been communicated securely. For example, if the NOC needs VPN access to client sites or accounts on certain servers, ensure those are created and shared via a secure channel. ConnectWise’s NOC team likely coordinated this during onboarding, but double-check that nothing is pending.

Important: For the right access level, credentials and documentation must be provided for NOC to function.

Verify NOC Activation: Work with your ConnectWise point of contact to confirm that the NOC service is aware of these newly enabled sites. There may be an official step where ConnectWise ops acknowledges the sites into their system. Also, test that alerts are indeed being picked up by NOC. For instance, cause a non-critical alert that should page NOC (maybe a test alert classified as such) and see if the NOC team responds or the ticket shows an assignment to NOC.
Refer to NOC Documentation: The ConnectWise documentation on NOC services (see ConnectWise Network Operations Center – NOC) contains additional information about how NOC handles tickets, what they do upon receiving them, and how they escalate. It’s beneficial to familiarize yourself with those details. This includes understanding the Service Level Agreement (SLA) that NOC operates under for different alert severities.
Monitor Initial NOC Tickets: As NOC starts handling real alerts, monitor a few cases closely. Ensure the workflow is smooth. NOC picks up the ticket, works on it, and either resolves it or escalates according to your defined process. Use this early period to adjust any thresholds or rules. For example, if you find NOC is getting alerted on too many trivial events, you might raise the alert thresholds, which can be done via RMM policies.

Deploying the NOC package effectively turns on proactive monitoring for those client environments at a 24×7 level. Your systems will now automatically create and assign tickets to the NOC team per the rules, offloading that responsibility from your in-house staff.

Phase 5: Execute Help Desk Services Per Site

Activate Help Desk services for client sites by following a structured onboarding process in Asio. This phase ensures that the Help Desk is properly configured, deployed, and ready to support end-users.

Steps:

Initiate Interest in Help Desk Services
In Asio, select I’m Interested for Help Desk under the site’s product options.
You’ll receive an email with educational resources, including the Getting Started with ConnectWise Help Desk Services course.
Complete the course before proceeding with activation.
Prepare for Activation
Choose the first site to activate.
Conduct a kickoff call with the client to introduce the Help Desk project.
Download the Help Desk Activation Workbook for internal tracking (not required for submission).
Configure Site Settings in Asio
Navigate to Settings > Setup > RMM and select the target site.
Click I’m Interested! Tell me how to get started.
Choose coverage level, start date, and anticipated seat count. This used for staffing, not billing.
Enable Help Desk Chat (Optional)
Toggle Help Desk Chat under Policies.

Note: Simply enabling chat does not deploy it, but it ensure policies and packages are properly configured.

Use deployment options to install chat icons on desktops or taskbars, and customize branding if desired.
Create Notification Rules
Go to RMM Setup > Notification Rules and create a new Help Desk rule.
Define escalation paths (e.g., MSP Escalation, Call Before Escalating, NOC Escalation).
Set time slots and contact preferences based on your internal support coverage.
Complete Help Desk Tab Configuration
In the site’s Help Desk tab, fill out:
Basic Info: Client phone number, email domain, greeting name, site message.
Client Profiles: Add contacts manually, via import, or sync from PSA.
Security Requests: Define approval workflows and enable mobile authentication if desired.
Enable Support Access
Under the Support Access tab, activate automated credentials for remote support.
Optionally, configure additional passwords and documentation access (e.g., ITGlue).
Final Review and Go-Live
Conduct an internal review of the setup.
Contact the Help Desk Activations Team to request go-live approval.
Once approved, notify the client and conduct expectation training using the provided PowerPoint template.
Post-Deployment Maintenance
Establish a review cycle for internal processes and documentation.
Conduct weekly escalation reviews during the first 30 days.
Engage your Partner Success Manager for ongoing support.
