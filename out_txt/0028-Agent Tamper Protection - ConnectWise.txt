Overview

The Agent has the core services and processes that control the entire agent. If the service is stopped or disabled, the agent will stop processing data from the endpoint, resulting in disabled monitoring. This feature makes the agent tamper-proof, so you can safely rely on the fact that the agent will be working and running on the endpoint and raising issues if observed.

Upon installation, the RMM agent will restrict end users from stopping Agent core services.

Note: 

This feature is only available for Windows agents.
Additionally, you can use the Agent Repair Utility, which helps identify the malfunctioning components of the RMM agent and also repairs them.
Tamper Protection

Users will not be able to perform any of the following actions:

The Agent service cannot be stopped from the user interface or Services.msc or from Task Manager.

The Agent service cannot be disabled from any user interface or services.msc or from Task Manager.

The settings of the service properties are disabled to perform any action as shown in the screenshot.

ITSplatform will not be visible in the Add/Remove programs list of Windows.

Agent service stop and disable action should be allowed only by the command line explicitly.

Technician Commands
