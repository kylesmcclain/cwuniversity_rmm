To adjust permissions:

You can adjust the permissions level of the Communicator, which lets you allow or deny access based on roles in the Asio Platform.

To adjust permissions:

Navigate to Settings > Account Administrations > Users > Default Users.

Select ON or OFF for the Communicator toggle. This allows you to hide or display the Communicator menu on the left navigation menu for this role. The following permissions can also be selected:

Other user roles can view messages sent only by a logged-in user.
