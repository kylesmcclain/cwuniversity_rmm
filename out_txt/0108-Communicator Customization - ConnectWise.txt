Custom URLs are the predefined set of menus that can be enabled on the Policy and can be customized with custom names and URLs. 

Up to three URLs can be added per Policy
Once the Custom URL menu is filled with data and saved,  the corresponding menu is reflected on the Communicator tray.
After clicking the menu, the URL is launched with the User's default browser.
Parent Custom Menus

Parent Custom Menus allow you to group URLs under one parent menu.

Up to two Parent Menus could be added per Policy.
A Parent Menu includes up to four child URL menus.

Custom Message Menu

You can create Message boxes within the Communicator tray to share more information with End-users. The message box will pop up on the end user's desktop with all the details provided by the partner in the Policy.
