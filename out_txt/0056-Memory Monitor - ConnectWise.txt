Overview

Memory Monitors allow you to trigger an alert and create a ticket when the Memory Utilization on the endpoint is less than a certain threshold for a specified number of minutes. Memory Monitors can be applied on Windows, Linux, and macOS endpoints

How to create a Memory Monitor

Navigate to  Endpoints > Alerts > Monitors.

Click Add Monitor.

Provide a Name for the new monitor. Optionally you can provide a Description of your new monitor.

Select the Type as Memory from the drop-down.

Select the Family and Severity.

To enable the Mapper functionality, you need to turn on the toggle. To learn more about the Mapper functionality review this documentation.

Under the Condition section:
Memory Utilization: Define the amount of available memory will trigger an alert. This is a Less than value.
Unit: Choose from the following units you want your monitor to use:
%: Allows you to define the free memory value in percentage on the endpoint.
MB: Allows you to define the free memory value in MB on the endpoint.
GB: Allows you to define the free memory value in GB on the endpoint.
Duration: Define the duration for which the Memory utilization value should be evaluated.   
You can also select a custom Automation Task to be executed when the condition was met on the endpoint
Ticket Update - Snooze: Duration for which the ticket updates should be ignored even when the issue persists/resurfaces on the drive.

Note: 

Ticket resolution threshold will override the Snooze and the ticket will be updated as NOC Completed. If the issue persists/resurfaces, a new ticket will be generated for the issue.
System will reflect only selective Automation tasks that do not need parameters. Refer these OOTB tasks which needs parameters. All Custom Scripts created will be available for selection.

Under the Ticket Resolution section you can define if the ticket should be updated as Resolved once the issue no longer persists on an endpoint using the following criteria:

Memory Utilization: Define the amount of available memory that will resolve the ticket. This is a More than value.
Unit: Choose which of the following units you want your monitor to use:
%: Allows you to define the free memory value in percentage on the endpoint.
MB: Allows you to define the free memory value in MB on the endpoint.
GB: Allows you to define the free memory value in GB on the endpoint.
Duration: Define the duration for which the Memory utilization value should be evaluated.   

Note: We strongly recommend adding some buffer in the thresholds defined for the Ticket Condition and Resolution. Keeping the same value in both would result in multiple tickets getting created and closed in short duration.

Under the Resources section, you can select the target endpoints on which the alerts should be triggered. You can select specific machines, Sites, or a Dynamic or a Static group.

Click Save to create and apply the monitor to the targets. 

Note: Monitors will be triggered based on the configuration set/defined.

List of Monitor Variables

Here is a list of variables which you can use as per your requirement when creating your own customized ticket template:

Monitor Type	Variable Name	Supported OS Type	Sample Data/Values	Variable Definition
Generic
 	ObservedDate	

Windows, MAC, Linux

	

"2020-09-02T15:35:42.969926103Z"

	Time stamp when the issue was observed
 	MonitorDesc	Windows, MAC, Linux	Add local palmtech account and add it to the local administrators group	Description added on the portal while creating a monitor
 	MonitorName	Windows, MAC, Linux	Local PalmTech Account with Local Admin	Name of the monitor
 	MonitorSummary	Windows, MAC, Linux	(Run PowerShell script every 1 minute(s) AND Run PowerShell script every 1 minute(s))	Summary information for the monitor
Memory
 	UsedMemory	Windows, MAC & Linux	980	Used memory in MB
 	AvailableMemory	Windows, MAC & Linux	1000	Available memory in MB
 	MemoryUtilization	Windows, MAC & Linux	10	Percentage of used memory in %
