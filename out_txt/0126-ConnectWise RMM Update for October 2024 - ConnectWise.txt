Overview 

This page provides information on the latest enhancements and features for ConnectWise RMM.

Announcements
Enabling Reason for Remote Access via Policies

We are developing a new way to enable users to enter the reason for taking remote access of a machine. Once this setting is enabled via policies and packages, the user will be prompted to enter the reason for taking remote access on every endpoint where this policy is effective.

Please review the ScreenConnect Join Reason Integration documentation for more information.

Upgrading sites to have RMM Product & Capabilities

Staying consistent with our Platform-first approach, we will now have our RMM agent tightly coupled with the RMM Enablement policy. Upon enabling this policy, the Platform Agent will be upgraded to RMM agent having all the existing RMM Product & Capabilities.

For more information, review the RMM Site Enablement documentation.

Note: These changes will be rolled out in a phased manner in the upcoming months.

RMM Agent now supports:
Windows on ARM processors
Snapdragon processors

We now officially support ARM-based processors which are used in Microsoft Surface devices.
