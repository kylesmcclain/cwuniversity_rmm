Overview 

This document provides an overview of major components, files, schedules, and other details for the enhanced RMM desktop and server agent.

Agent File Details 

The following table provides file and registry locations for agent files on 32-bit and 64-bit systems. Install and uninstall log files are stored in the JunoSetupLogs folder inside program files. Agent logs are stored in the log folder ITSPlatform.

Agent Remote Connections 
The agent requires an internet connection to contact the data center. If the connection is lost, actions such as heartbeat and configuration updates or changes made in the Asio will not download.
The agent continues to run tasks scheduled in the platform_agent_schedule_cfg.json file, such as collecting asset and performance data.
To block remote access, stop the Asio service.
The Asio service internally calls the platform-agent-core.exe file, which runs over port 80 to post keep-alive status to the datacenter.
The agent only requires outbound connections on port 80.

Local Database 
cntm.agent.db.db: This SQLite database stores the webposts that were not successful since the agent went offline because of any kind of network problem. After the agent is back online, these webposts are sent to the data center.
mailboxmsg.db: This SQLite database stores the message IDs and processing status of mailbox messages received from our data center.
