Custom Fields for Company/Site

Partners that have migrated to the ConnectWise SSO and enabled our Company/Site hierarchy will get an option to create or manage the custom fields at Company/Site levels.

ConnectWise RMM
Agent and Platform

Agent Update. A new agent, version 3.0.3, will be rolled out on January 20th. Windows, MAC, and Linux agents will be updated to the latest version automatically.

Automation

Automation Support for Custom Field Variables from Company/Site. When searching for Custom Fields using the Script Functions Set Custom Field and Set Pre-Defined Value, partners can see a new column called "Source" that displays whether the Custom Field exists on the Endpoint, Site, or Company level.

Note: Script Functions Set Custom Field and Set Pre-Defined Value already supports all Custom Fields.

Reporting

Legacy Executive Report Depreciation. We will be deprecating the Legacy Executive reports for the ConnectWise RMM partners which is available from the legacy reports section.

Ticketing / PSA Integration

Rebranding of ConnectWise Manage. We are rebranding the ConnectWise Manage PSA integration to ConnectWise PSA across all sections/pages.

Bug Fixes / Known Issues

The following issues will be resolved with this month's release:

Portal - CES migrated partners will be able to see the Company Name when selecting a site in Agent Download from the Networking Tab or in the Cloned Devices sections.

Platform - Fixed an issue where the Customs monitors page was taking around 30-45 seconds to load the data and in some cases, it would return a blank page.

Device Groups - Resolved an issue where the user is trying to apply keywords to filter sites. It will now apply to all sites instead of filtered sites.

Device Groups - Resolved an issue where the Machine role criteria was not returning the correct data for the target endpoints.

Automation - Resolved the Tasking Error "error_invalid_endpoint_status" that occurs when sending trigger First Check-in for execution.

Automation - Resolved an issue where Scheduled Tasks did not work with a user's Site access.

Patching - We have fixed an issue where the Application Updates which were not created by Client Site Manager users were visible to Client Site Manager users.

Patching - We have fixed an issue where the patching assessment failure alerts was not getting generated for the servers.
