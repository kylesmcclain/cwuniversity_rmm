Overview

Integration Monitors allow you to define a monitor for fields that are enabled as part of an integration. These integration fields are automatically enabled and updated as part of integration values.

How to create an Integration Field Monitor

Navigate to Endpoints > Alerts > Monitors.

Click Add Monitor.

Provide a Name for the new monitor. You can also add an optional Description of your new monitor.

Select the Type as Integration field from the drop-down for creating the appropriate monitor.

Select the Family and Severity from the drop-down menus.

To enable the Mapper functionality, you need to turn on the toggle. To learn more about the Mapper functionality review this documentation.

Under Condition section:

Integration Name - Name of the integration.

Integration Field Name - It will display the lists of integration-field-names along with the datatype that are pre-created via integrations. If no integrations are enabled or no such fields are pushed in the Asio solution from the vendor, it will not display any details.

Datepicker - For fields where values will be Date and time stamps.

Equals - Matches with the value.

Not Equal - Does not match the value.

Greater Than - The value is greater than.

Less Than - The value is less than.

DropDown - For fields where values will be one of the available options

Contains - The value must contain the keywords.

Does not contain - The value does not contain the keywords.

Equals - Matches with the value.

Not Equals - Does not match the value.

Number - For fields where value will be a number.

Equals - Matches with the value.

Not Equals - Does not match with the value.

Greater Than - The value is greater than.

Less Than - The value is less than.

Text box - For fields where values will be textual.

Contains - The value must contain the keywords.

Does not contain - The value does not contain the keywords

Equals - Matches with the value.

Not Equals - Does not match with the value.

Logical Operator - A logical operator can be used with the following types of the integration field types: Dropdown and Text Box. You can define multiple values that can be validated for the alert generated (based on values).

Values - You can define the field values to be used when triggering an alert.

Select a custom Automation Task to be executed when the condition is met on the endpoints.

Note: System will reflect only selective Automation tasks that do not need parameters. Refer these OOTB tasks which needs parameters. All Custom Scripts created will be available for selection.
